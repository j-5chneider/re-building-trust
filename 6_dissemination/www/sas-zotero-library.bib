This is most true in northwest Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and Korea and least true in southern Europe, Brazil and Malaysia where teachers fall between the two views. \textbullet{} In the classroom, teachers in all countries put greater emphasis on ensuring that learning is well structured than on student-oriented activities which give them more autonomy. Both of these teaching practices are emphasised more than enhanced learning activities such as project work. This pattern is true in every country. \textbullet{} Co-operation by teachers in all countries more commonly takes the form of exchanging and co-ordinating ideas and information than direct professional collaboration such as team teaching. \textbullet{} At least half of teachers in most countries spend over 80\{\%\} of their lesson time on teaching and learning. However, one in four teachers in most countries lose at least 30\{\%\} of their lesson time, and some lose more than half, through disruptions and administrative tasks. This is closely associated with the classroom disciplinary climate. Country and school differences in this respect are less important than differences among teachers within schools. \textbullet{} Almost all Norwegian teachers report better than average relationships between teachers and students. In other countries, teacher-student relationships vary considerably. Only part of this variation is related to differences among schools. Even though teacher-student relations are often seen as a feature of schools as a whole, different teachers within schools perceive them differently.},

  abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (``hopes'') and negative expectations (``fears''). These were uncorrelated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.},

Two years later occupational strain was measured. Four years after graduation we again assessed occupational strain and occupational self-efficacy, and we additionally measured specific teacher-stress. Predictions were tested by means of a causal-analytical model; High instrumentality as well as high occupational self-efficacy led to reduced stress experiencing, whereas part-time employment goals and also work-life balance goals led to increased stress-experiencing. Gender had no influence. We discuss the usefulness of a self-regulatory approach that integrates the self-concept, self-efficacy beliefs and career goal orientations into the analysis of teacher stress.

Diese Einsicht blieb lange Zeit unber{\"u}cksichtigt, wahrscheinlich aus dem einfachen Grund, weil die Analyse des Zielsetzens anhand von Erwartungs-Wert-Modellen sehr erfolgreich war (Festinger, 1942; Atkinson, 1957) und so die ganze Aufmerksamkeit der Motivationspsychologie band. Erst mit dem Erwachen der Zielpsychologie (beginnend mit Klingers \guillemotright{}current concerns\guillemotleft, 1977, und Wicklund und Gollwitzers \guillemotright{}self-definitional goals\guillemotleft, 1982) und der Psychologie der Handlungskontrolle basierend auf Kuhls Analyse der Lage- vs. Handlungsorientierung, 1983; {$\blacktriangleright$} detaillierte Ausf{\"u}hrungen in Kap. 13) wurde den Prozessen und den mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Strategien der Zielrealisierung die Aufmerksamkeit zu teil, die ihnen Kurt Lewin bereits in den 40er-Jahren zugedacht hatte (Oettingen \& Gollwitzer, 2001). Menschliches Verhalten aus einer Handlungsperspektive zu betrachten, bedeutet im Gegensatz zu einer behavioristischen Betrachtungsweise auch, die Analyse des Verhaltens nicht nur auf das Reagieren und das Ausf{\"u}hren gelernter Gewohnheiten zu begrenzen.},

Currently used ES are expressed in statistical rather than in clinically useful terms and may not give clinicians the appropriate information. We restrict our discussion to studies with two groups: one with n patients receiving a new treatment and the other with m patients receiving the usual or no treatment. The standardized mean difference (e.g. Cohen's d) is a well-known index for continuous outcomes. There is some intuitive value to d, but measuring improvement in standard deviations (SD) is a statistical concept that may not help a clinician. How much improvement is a half SD? A more intuitive and simple-to-calculate ES is the probability that the response of a patient given the new treatment (X) is better than the one for a randomly chosen patient given the old or no treatment (Y) (i.e. P(X {$>$} Y), larger values meaning better outcomes). This probability has an immediate identity with the area under the curve (AUC) measure in procedures for receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve comparing responses to two treatments. It also can be easily calculated from the Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, or Kendall tau statistics. We describe the characteristics of an ideal ES. We propose P(X {$>$} Y) as an alternative index, summarize its correspondence with well-known non-parametric statistics, compare it to the standardized mean difference index, and illustrate with clinical data.},

In the presence of missing values, a researcher has three goals, and these goals provide the standard for evaluating alternative strategies: 1. Maximize the information used in the analysis; 2. Minimize the bias in estimating model parameters; and 3. Minimize the bias in estimating standard errors by correctly reflecting the degree of uncertainty associated with parameter estimates. In this chapter, I review some traditional ways of handling missing values that yield unbiased estimates of the parameters and seriously underestimate the uncertainty of these estimates. The standard errors will be too small, and this results in erroneous statistical significance, that is, a Type 2 error. Unbiased estimates of the standard error must reflect two key elements: (a) the gain in certainty that is obtained by using all available information, and (b) the loss in certainty obtained depending on how missing values are handled.

First, we examined all nonsignificant findings mentioned in the abstracts of the 2015 volumes of Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, and Psychological Science (N = 137). In 72\% of these cases, nonsignificant results were misinterpreted, in that the authors inferred that the effect was absent. Second, a Bayes factor reanalysis revealed that fewer than 5\% of the nonsignificant findings provided strong evidence (i.e., BF01 {$>$} 10) in favor of the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis. We recommend that researchers expand their statistical tool kit in order to correctly interpret nonsignificant results and to be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the null hypothesis.},

Moreover, the model includes several existing multidimensional models as special cases, including Whitely's multicomponent latent trait model, Andersen's multidimensional Rasch model for repeated testing, and Embretson's multidimensional Rasch model for learning and change.

  abstract = {Learning analytics is the analysis of electronic learning data which allows teachers, course designers and administrators of virtual learning environments to search for unobserved patterns and underlying information in learning processes. The main aim of learning analytics is to improve learning outcomes and the overall learning process in electronic learning virtual classrooms and computer-supported education. The most basic unit of learning data in virtual learning environments for learning analytics is the interaction, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions are relevant for effective learning. Drawing upon extant literature, this research defines three system-independent classifications of interactions and evaluates the relation of their components with academic performance across two different learning modalities: virtual learning environment (VLE) supported face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. In order to do so, we performed an empirical study with data from six online and two VLE-supported F2F courses. Data extraction and analysis required the development of an ad hoc tool based on the proposed interaction classification. The main finding from this research is that, for each classification, there is a relation between some type of interactions and academic performance in online courses, whereas this relation is non-significant in the case of VLE-supported F2F courses. Implications for theory and practice are discussed next. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Representations were compared to written justification to gauge consistency and data were analyzed to identify relational patterns, with six stable patterns emerging from the conceptions (e.g., knowledge establishment and truth establishment). A content analysis was performed to: (a) identify the specific language frequently used to define these terms, and (b) contrast definitions as a whole to conceptions that populate the psychological and related literatures. The significance of the resulting patterns is considered in light of the literature in epistemic beliefs and empirical implications and practical relevance are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The connotations of a language expression are pragmatic effects that arise from encyclopaedic knowledge about its denotation (or reference) and also from experiences, beliefs, and prejudices about the contexts in which the expression is typically used. The connotation of a language expression is clearly distinct from its sense, denotation and reference. For example, Mike and Michael can have the same reference but different connotations. John is an unsuitable name for your new-born daughter; so is Springtime in Paris an inappropriate name for a 1200cc Harley-Davidson motorbike or an auto-repair shop. Identifying the connotations of a term is to identify the community attitude towards it. For instance the connotations of English octopus and the Japanese translation equivalent tako are very different: an octopus is a sinister, alien creature; tako is edible and endearing. Connotation is intimately involved with notions of appropriateness in language use; i.e. with pragmatic effect. For instance, racist dysphemisms occur when a speaker refers to or implicates the hearer or some third person's race, ethnicity, or nationality in such terms as to cause a face affront. Many such 'racist' terms can be disarmed by being used, without irony, as in-group solidarity markers by the targeted group; e.g. the use of nigger/nigga among African Americans. The negative connotations of some existing word often lead to its replacement. Although Jesus Christ! is blasphemous; Gee whiz and By jingo are not. From a purely rational viewpoint, if one of these is blasphemous, then all of them are. But the pragmatic effects, i.e. connotations are different. Connotation is a thoroughly pragmatic category of meaning. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To date, IOEDs have been identified only in mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the social psychological domain of electoral voting (Studies 5 and 6), demonstrating the generality of the construal mechanism, the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of the effect beyond mechanical and natural domains. These findings suggest a novel factor that might contribute to such diverse social-cognitive shortcomings as stereotyping, egocentrism, and the planning fallacy, where people adopt abstract representations of concepts that should be represented concretely.},

  abstract = {Little P value What are you trying to say Of significance? \textemdash{}Steve Ziliak The significance of experimental results is often assessed using P values and estimates of effect size. However, the interpreta-tion of these assessment tools can be invalidated by selection bias when testing multiple hypotheses, fitting multiple models or even informally selecting results that seem interesting after observing the data. Our goal this month will be to identify some circumstances that can give rise to such questionable practices\textemdash{} broadly termed 'P value hacking' and 'data dredging' . In addition, statistically significant results may not translate into biologically meaningful conclusions\textemdash{}with large sample sizes or small vari-ability, even tiny effects can be statistically significant. We have previously seen how to correctly interpret P values in the context of high-throughput 'omics' experiments in which the multiple testing is explicit 1 . We discussed the number of false discoveries that can be expected when a fixed P value is used to reject the null hypothesis. Here, to illustrate how P values can lead us astray, we reverse that process and instead ask: what is the smallest P value we can expect if the null hypothesis is true but we have done many tests, either explicitly or implicitly? Consider a study in which 10 physiological variables are mea-sured in 100 individuals to determine whether any of the vari-ables are predictive of systolic blood pressure (SBP). Suppose that none of the variables are actually predictive in the population and that they are all independent. If we use simple linear regression 2 and focus on one of the variables as a predictor, a test of associa-tion will yield P {$<$} 0.05 in 5\% of samples (Fig. 1a). However, if we test each of our predictors, there is now a 40\% chance that we'll find P {$<$} 0.05 for at least one. How does this arise? When we search for the most significant result, we do not have a fixed null hypothesis. It's entirely possible that a different predictor would be identified as most significant in the next repetition of the experiment. In reporting the most significant P value, we are actu-ally considering the distribution of the minimum of 10 random uni-form distributions (Fig. 1b). This distribution is readily computed and has density k(1 \textendash{} x) k \textendash{} 1 for k independent tests. Using k = 10, the probability of observing P {$<$} 0.05 is 1 \textendash{} (1 \textendash{} 0.05) 10 = 0.40 (Fig. 1b). Reporting a statistically significant result as if this were the only test performed is an example of selection bias and leads to inflated claims of statistical significance. It's important to realize that it does not matter whether or not the tests were actually performed\textemdash{}any choice of results based on the outcome, rather than on prespecified hypotheses, will lead to selection bias. We have previously seen that multiplicity adjustment is one way to fix selection bias for P values 1 . Using the adjusted P values from a family-wise error rate or false discovery rate guards against over-interpreting the P values when multiple testing has been done. However, it is less clear how to do this when an interesting effect has been detected after exploration of the data. For example, if we plotted SBP against each of our 10 predictors and felt that 1 predictor might have a quadratic relationship with SBP, should we adjust for 10 comparisons (the 10 plots), 20 comparisons (linear or quadratic effects) or more (to account for nonlinear relationships)? The more models we consider, the greater the danger of overfitting the data and producing false positives. A common suggestion for supplementing P values is to report the confidence interval for the effect. Does this assist with selec-tion bias? Figure 2 shows the confidence intervals corresponding to the testing scenarios in Figure 1. When we perform 100 single hypothesis tests when the null is true, only 5\% of the confidence intervals do not cover 0 (Fig. 2a). This picture looks very different if we consider only the most significant confidence interval from among 10 tests (Fig. 2b). On average, 40\% of the confidence inter-vals do not cover 0, which should not be surprising, as we've already shown that this is the fraction of the underlying P values that are less than 0.05 (Fig. 1b). Selection bias is not addressed or corrected merely by reporting both the P value and the confidence interval. Another common analysis in which P values can easily be mis-interpreted is the selection of a prediction model for multiple regression or classification. To show how this can occur, we per-formed 1,000 simulations of our 10 physiological variables that were, as before, random and independent of each other and of SBP. We then applied forward selection to identify variables that Figure 1 | P values are random variables. In assessing statistical significance, we rely on their distribution when the null hypothesis, H 0 ,is true. (a) Simulated P values from 1,000 statistical tests when H 0 is true. The distribution is uniform and, on average, 5\% of P {$<$} 0.05 (blue). (b) The distribution of the minimum P value across 1,000 simulations of 10 tests when H 0 is true. Now, on average, 40\% of P {$<$} 0.05 (blue). Note the difference in y-axis scale compared to a.},

  abstract = {Educators are under tremendous pressure to ensure that their students perform well on tests. Unfortunately, this pressure has caused some educators to cheat. The purpose of this study was to investigate the types of, and degrees to which, a sample of teachers in Arizona were aware of, or had themselves engaged in test-related cheating practices as a function of the high-stakes testing policies of No Child Left Behind. A near census sample of teachers was surveyed, with valid responses obtained from about 5 percent, totaling just over 3,000 teachers. In addition, one small convenience sample of teachers was interviewed, and another participated in a focus group. Data revealed that cheating occurs and that educators can be quite clever when doing so. But how one defines cheating makes it difficult to quantify the frequency with which educators engage in such practices. Our analysis thus required us to think about a taxonomy of cheating based on the definitions of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree offenses in the field of law. These categories were analyzed to help educators better define, and be more aware of others' and their own cheating practices, in an attempt to inform local testing policies and procedures.

Students were surveyed in school regarding their cheating behaviors in math, and the motivational goal structures perceived in their math classrooms. Surveys were completed twice during the eighth grade (during middle school) and once at the end of the ninth grade (at the end of the first year in high school). Results indicated that self-reported cheating did not change in the year prior to the high school transition, but that reported cheating increased after the transition. Additional analyses indicated that across the high school transition, self-reported cheating in math increased for students who moved from high mastery to low mastery-oriented classes after the transition, and for students who moved from low performance to high performance-oriented classes; in contrast, self-reported cheating decreased for students who moved from low to high mastery-oriented math classrooms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~n}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

We found substantial normative dissonance, particularly between espoused ideals and respondents' perceptions of other scientists' typical behavior. Also, respondents on average saw other scientists' behavior as more counternormative than normative. Scientists' views of their fields as cooperative or competitive were associated with their normative perspectives, with competitive fields showing more counternormative behavior.

Eighty years later, we launch the sixth edition of the Publication Manual in the same spirit. This edition of the Publication Manual has been extensively revised to reflect new standards in publishing and new practices in information dissemination. New technologies have made increasingly sophisticated analyses possible, just as they have accelerated the dissemination of those analyses in multiple forms, from blogs to personal Web postings to articles published in online databases. To provide readers with guidance on how these and other developments have affected scholarly publishing, we have reordered and condensed the manual significantly. Our first goal was to simplify the reader's job by compiling all information on a topic in a single place. We have ordered information in accordance with the publication process, beginning with the idea stage and ending with the publication stage. We have retained and strengthened the basic rules of APA writing style and the guidelines on avoiding bias in language that were first published by APA more than 30 years ago. Most important, we have significantly expanded guidance on ethics, statistics, journal article reporting standards, electronic reference formats, and the construction of tables and figures. Key to this revision is an updated and expanded web presence, which exponentially increases the information we are able to provide. At www.apastyle.org, readers will find a full range of resources for learning APA Style as well as additional guidance on writing and publishing, which will evolve with changing standards and practices.

Educational Researcher, 15(2), 414. Based on the work undertaken by the QUASAR project with middle school mathe- matics teachers, we engaged a group of seven high school mathematics teachers in learning about the Levels of Cognitive Demand, a set of criteria that can be used to examine mathematical tasks critically. Using qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, we sought to understand how focusing the teachers on critically examining mathematical tasks influenced their thinking about the nature of mathematical tasks as well as their choice of tasks to use in their classrooms. Our research indicates that the teachers showed growth in the ways that they consider tasks, and that some of the teachers changed their patterns of task choice. Further, this study provides a new research instrument for measuring teachers growth in pedagogical content knowledge.},

This approach is compared with models that ignore the hierarchy, and models in which the hierarchy is represented by a fixed parameter for each cluster. It is shown, by simulation, that simple models with dummy variables outperform both random effect models and models ignoring the hierarchy in terms of balance of cluster-level unobserved covariates and omitted variable bias. The representation of the clusters by fixed or random effects defines a model more general than would be ideal if the relevant cluster-level variables were available. The general conclusion confirms that when conducting propensity score analysis it is safer to specify a more general model than pursuing model parsimony.},

With automated email and text message reminders that can be sent according to any schedule, longitudinal and experience-sampling studies become easy to implement. By integrating a web-based application programming interface for the statistical programming language R via OpenCPU, formr allows researchers to use a familiar programming language to enable complex features. These can range from adaptive testing, to graphical and interactive feedback, to integration with non-survey data sources such as self-trackers or online social network data. Here we showcase three studies created in formr: a study of couples with dyadic feedback; a longitudinal study over months, which included social networks and peer and partner ratings; and a diary study with daily invitations sent out by text message and email and extensive feedback on intraindividual patterns.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"o}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test\textendash{}retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each concep- tual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. More- over, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill develop- ment, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching. The},

The results suggest that: (a) students reach eventually the same level of CT skills development independent of their age and gender, (b) CT skills in most cases need time to fully develop (students' scores improve significantly towards the end of the activity), (c) age and gender relevant differences appear when analysing students' score in the various specific dimensions of the CT skills model, (d) the modality of the skill assessment instrument may have an impact on students' performance, (e) girls appear in many situations to need more training time to reach the same skill level compared to boys.},

In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data.

This paper reviews this large body of research and, in so doing, explores a host of factors that might impact upon teacher acceptance of the inclusion principle. The analyses showed evidence of positive attitudes, but no evidence of acceptance of a total inclusion or `zero reject' approach to special educational provision. Teachers' attitudes were found to be strongly in uenced by the nature and severity of the disabling condition presented to them (child-related variables) and less by teacher-related variables. Further, educational environment-related variables, such as the availability of physical and human support, were consistently found to be associated with attitudes to inclusion. After a brief discussion of critical methodological issues germane to the research findings, the paper provides directions for future research based on alternative methodologies.},

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.

Three types of investigations are identified: examinations of observed relationships between social experiences and belief understanding, attempts to facilitate the reasoning of children on the verge of belief understanding through experiences intended to compel children to face reasoning inconsistencies; and training studies demonstrating that children can be trained to understand belief over time through specific feedback experiences. A comparison of these studies reveals that experience is defined differently across them, resulting in varying and sometimes ambiguous implications for a theory-theory perspective on development. Implications for future research are discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The study examines how absolutist and evaluativist epistemic perspectives come into play in two key online inquiry strategies\textemdash{}evaluation of website trustworthiness and critical integration of multiple online sources. The study explores students' epistemic thinking on the cognitive and metacognitive levels and examines epistemic metacognitive knowledge about both persons and strategies. The findings demonstrate that epistemic thinking plays an important role in online inquiry learning. Participants' epistemic metacognitive knowledge regarding online learning strategies correlated with their epistemic cognition. Evaluativists significantly outperformed absolutists in the integration strategy but no significant differences were found in the evaluation strategy.

The contested and diverse nature of both constructs makes untangling their connections a complex yet vital task. The purpose of this article is to advance the discussion regarding this intersection by offering a theoretical approach that may serve as a basis for analyzing epistemic thinking and aligning it with current views of metacognition. Based on a synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies, we argue that epistemic thinking is a multifaceted construct with both cognitive and metacognitive aspects. Furthermore, we propose that epistemic metacognition includes several aspects such as metacognitive skills; metacognitive knowledge about persons, strategies and tasks; and metacognitive experiences. The theoretical, methodological, and instructional implications of this approach are explored.},

Sourcing can be particularly challenging when lay readers encounter conflicting expert accounts of controversial topics, a situation which is increasingly common when learning online. The aim of this study was to examine learners' spontaneous sourcing as they read divergent expert accounts of a socio-scientific controversy in order to map prevalent sourcing practices and to identify specific challenges. Additionally, the study explored the role of learners' epistemic perspectives in sourcing, and examined the relations between sourcing while reading and subsequent written argumentation. Sixty-one university students thought aloud while reading four conflicting blog-posts about a socio-scientific controversy and then wrote arguments regarding the controversy. The findings revealed a wide range of sourcing practices. Some participants did not explicitly engage in sourcing while reading, whereas others formed detailed source representations, source-content links, and source-source links. Although most participants constructed source representations, these representations were infrequently acted upon. Multiplism was negatively related to sourcing and positively related to reliance on the reader as a source of knowledge. Higher levels of sourcing were related to more complex argumentation, increased claim justification, and better integration of sources in participants' arguments. The theoretical and instructional implications of these findings are explored.},

Previous studies have found that learners' epistemic metacognitive knowledge about the nature of knowledge and knowing is related to their strategic integration perfor- mance. The purpose of this study was to understand how these relations come into play as students learn to integrate divergent information sources. To do so, we examined the contri- bution of scaffolds addressing the epistemic strategy of integration and epistemic metastrategic knowledge about this strategy. Participants were 99 high-achieving Arab Israeli ninth graders. All participants engaged in writing arguments based on divergent information sources. Stu- dents in the control condition received no scaffolds; students in the strategic condition received a strategic scaffold; and students in the metastrategic condition received both strategic and metastrategic scaffolds. Integration performance, epistemic metastrategic knowledge about integration, and absolutist, multiplist, and evaluativist epistemic perspectives were measured before, immediately after, and one month after the intervention. At pre-test, both epistemic metastrategic knowledge about integration and evaluativism were positive predictors of integration performance. The strategic scaffold led to a significant increase in integration performance and epistemic metastrategic knowledge. Adding the metastrategic scaffold led to greater improvement in epistemic metastrategic knowledge, but did not result in additional gains in strategic performance. An immediate decrease in absolutism occurred among all participants but was not sustained over time. A decrease in multiplism occurred only in the experimental groups and was sustained over time. The results suggest that epistemic growth can occur in both bottom-up and top-down directions},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Klasse verlassen und auf ein grundst{\"a}ndiges Gymnasium wechseln, h{\"o}here Lernzuw{\"a}chse im Leseverst{\"a}ndnis und in Mathematik erreichen. Auf der Grundlage von Daten der ELEMENT-Studie wurde die Leistungsentwicklung von Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}lern aus Berliner grundst{\"a}ndigen Gymnasien ( N = 1758) und Grundschulen ( N = 3167) w{\"a}hrend der 5. und 6. Jahrgangsstufe mithilfe von Regressions- und Propensity Score Matching - Analysen (PSM) modelliert. Nach Kontrolle von Eingangsunterschieden zwischen den Schulformen zeigten sich f{\"u}r das Leseverst{\"a}ndnis keine statistisch signifi kanten Unterschiede. F{\"u}r die Mathematikleistung lie{\ss}en sich kleine positive Effekte f{\"u}r die Fr{\"u}h{\"u}berg{\"a}nger lediglich mithilfe der Regressionsanalyse nachweisen. Das Ergebnis konnte im PSM nicht repliziert werden. Die Befunde sprechen gegen die Annahme, dass mit dem fr{\"u}hen {\"U}bergang auf ein grundst{\"a}ndiges Gymnasium eine generelle F{\"o}rderung der Lesef{\"a}higkeit und des mathematischen Verst{\"a}ndnisses besonders leistungsf{\"a}higer Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler erreicht wird.

It was predicted that 5 epistemic dimensions would explain unique variance in moral reasoning over and above all other variables. This hypothesis was confirmed. Beliefs corresponding to simple knowledge, certain knowledge, omniscient authority, and quick learning each explained the significant variation in performance on the Defining Issues Test (J. R. Rest, 1979). Results showed that multiple epistemic assumptions play an important role in young adults' moral reasoning over and above other social and personal variables. Implications concerning the development of epistemic beliefs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

We also propose a more integrated model that elaborates on the following fundamental elements of personal epistemology: (a) a mechanism of change (i.e., epistemic doubt, epistemic volition, and resolution strategies), (b) dimensions of beliefs, (c) advanced beliefs, (d) metacognition, (e) conditions for change (i.e., dissonance and personal relevance), (f) affect, (g) cognitive abilities and environment, and (h) reciprocal causation. Our goal in developing this model is to integrate many of the salient theoretical issues raised by the diverse models of personal epistemology represented in this special issue as a way to guide and inform future research and educational practice.},

  abstract = {Epistemic beliefs are individuals' beliefs about knowledge and knowing. Modelling them is currently based on two central assumptions. First, epistemic beliefs are conceptualized as a multi-level construct, i.e. they exist on a general, academic, domain-specific and/or topic-specific level. Second, research assumes that their more concrete levels predict learning processes and outcomes more strongly than their more general levels. However, studies directly investigating these assumptions are still missing. 975 prospective retailers, wholesalers, bank assistants, and industrial assistants reported their grades and learning motivation in accounting and marketing as well as their epistemic beliefs in an effort to prove both assumptions within the context of Vocational Education and Training. Second-order confirmatory factor analysis confirms the multi-level conceptualization of epistemic beliefs. The findings here indicate a superiority of domain- and topic-specific epistemic beliefs compared to general epistemic beliefs for predicting motivation and achievement in marketing and accounting. The study concludes that domain- and topic-specific epistemic beliefs explain different facets of learning phenomena. In addition, further research should concentrate more on both the domain- and topic-specific levels.},

Drawing on sensemaking and attribution theory and data collected in six middle schools, we find that while teachers most often attributed outcomes to their own instruction, they also frequently focused on supposedly stable student characteristics. By citing these characteristics as explanations for the results analyzed, teachers may have inhibited reflection on their practice and reinforced low expectations for English language learners (ELLs) and students in special education. These findings yield implications for (a) the effectiveness of data use reforms and (b) equity in the education of ELLs and students in special education.},

However, empirical support for this relationship has been mixed, with most recent studies finding no evidence that downturns provoke greater racial animosity. Yet most past research has focused on hate crimes, a particularly violent and relatively infrequent manifestation of racial antipathy. In this article, we reexamine the relationship between economic downturns and racial acrimony using more subtle indicators of racial animosity. We found that during economic downturns, Whites felt less warmly about Blacks (Studies 1 and 2), held more negative explicit and implicit attitudes about Blacks, were more likely to condone the use of stereotypes, and were more willing to regard inequality between groups as natural and acceptable (Study 2). Moreover, during downturns, Black musicians (Study 3) and Black politicians (Study 4) were less likely to secure a musical hit or win a congressional election.},

The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.},

  abstract = {When modeling multilevel data, it is important to accurately represent the interdependence of observations within clusters. Ignoring data clustering may result in parameter misestimation. However, it is not well established to what degree parameter estimates are affected by model misspecification when applying missing data techniques (MDTs) to incomplete multilevel data. We compare the performance of three MDTs with incomplete hierarchical data. We consider the impact of imputation model misspecification on the quality of parameter estimates by employing multiple imputation under assumptions of a normal model (MI/NM) with two-level cross-sectional data when values are missing at random on the dependent variable at rates of 10\%, 30\%, and 50\%. Five criteria are used to compare estimates from MI/NM to estimates from MI assuming a linear mixed model (MI/LMM) and maximum likelihood estimation to the same incomplete data sets. With 10\% missing data (MD), techniques performed similarly for fixed-effects estimates, but variance components were biased with MI/NM. Effects of model misspecification worsened at higher rates of MD, with the hierarchical structure of the data markedly underrepresented by biased variance component estimates. MI/LMM and maximum likelihood provided generally accurate and unbiased parameter estimates but performance was negatively affected by increased rates of MD. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The 2nd purpose of this chapter is to extend the discussion of agreement, reliability, and non-independence from an exclusive focus on validating one's measurement model to a broader focus that includes testing substantive models and detecting emergent phenomena.

Zum einen wird die Lehrerbildung in ihrer Gesamtstruktur und Entwicklung sowie im Hinblick auf grunds{\"a}tzliche Fragen ihrer Gestaltung thematisiert (Kapitel 1 und 2). Zum anderen erfolgt eine Orientierung an der internen horizontalen und vertikalen Struktur der Lehrerbildung, indem die Phasen und ihre Orte sowie die einzelnen Ausbildungsg{\"a}nge Ber{\"u}cksichtigung finden (Kapitel 3 und 4). Zum dritten werden spezifische Inhalte der Lehrerbildung angesprochen, und zwar aus der Sicht ihrer erziehungswissenschaftlichen, fachwissenschaftlichen, fachdidaktischen und schulpraktischen Komponenten, aus der Sicht der beruflichen Aufgaben von Lehrerinnen und Lehrern sowie aus der Sicht f{\"a}cher{\"u}bergreifender Schl{\"u}sselthemen (Kapitel 5 bis 7).

Aufgaben kommt im Lehr-Lernprozess eine zentrale Bedeutung zu. Als Anforderungen an die Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler sowie Objekt ihrer Aktivit{\"a}ten sollen sie Lernprozesse anregen. Daher stellt die Ermittlung ihrer Qualit{\"a}t einen bedeutsamen Beitrag zur Ermittlung von Unterrichtsqualit{\"a}t dar.

In diesem Zusammenhang wird ein fach{\"u}bergreifendes Modell entwickelt, welches die drei Unterrichtsperspektiven Inhalt, Lehren und Lernen umfasst, und es wird ein darauf bezogenes dreistufiges Analyseverfahren vorgestellt, das zwischen dem objektiven Potenzial einer Aufgabe, den intendierten Anforderungen seitens der Lehrperson und der Realisierung dieser Anforderungen im Lehr-Lernprozess unterscheidet. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus erfolgt exemplarisch eine Aufgabenanalyse anhand einer Mathematikstunde in der Jahrgangsstufe 11. (ZPID).},

  abstract = {In this paper, the state of research on the assessment of competencies in higher education is reviewed. Fundamental conceptual and methodological issues are clarified by showing that current controversies are built on misleading dichotomies. By systematically sketching conceptual controversies, competing competence definitions are unpacked (analytic/trait vs. holistic/real-world performance) and commonplaces are identified. Disagreements are also highlighted. Similarly, competing statistical approaches to assessing competencies, namely item-response theory (latent trait) versus generalizability theory (sampling error variance), are unpacked. The resulting framework moves beyond dichotomies and shows how the different approaches complement each other. Competence is viewed along a continuum from traits that underlie perception, interpretation, and decision-making skills, which in turn give rise to observed behavior in real-world situations. Statistical approaches are also viewed along a continuum from linear to nonlinear models that serve different purposes. Item response theory (IRT) models may be used for scaling item responses and modeling structural relations, and generalizability theory (GT) models pinpoint sources of measurement error variance, thereby enabling the design of reliable measurements. The proposed framework suggests multiple new research studies and may serve as a "grand" structural model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {Background: Institutions of higher education, specifically schools of education, should play a pivotal role in supporting educators' development of data literacy for teaching. While novice teachers are often prepared to use test-based assessment data, they learn these experiences in isolated courses that do not connect to instruction or school improvement. Moreover, once these novice teachers begin working in schools, they are increasingly expected to work with colleagues to apply data literacy skills, yet few preparation programs provide sustained support with using data collaboratively for whole-school improvement. Purpose: This essay describes the habits of mind, or xuays of thinking and being, that underlie data literacy courses offered by the Data Wise Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The habits include: shared commitment to action, assessment, and adjustment; intentional collaboration; and relentless focus on evidence. Adding an emphasis on habits of mind expands building data literacy beyond accumulating discrete knowledge and skills or learning a process that becomes routine. Research Design: The authors provide suggestions for instructional design than can be incorporated both in degree-program courses and in ongoing professional development. These suggestions provide opportunities for participants to actively cultivate the three habits of mind. Conclusions: In order to support all educators while learning data literacy for teaching, there is a need to bridge the resources of an institution of higher education with the instructional capacity of professional development providers and the authentic experiences of school-based practitioners.

  abstract = {Lay SummaryThere are often reasons to expect certain relations between the variances of multiple populations. For example, in an educational study one might expect that the variance of students' performances increases or decreases across grades. Alternatively, it might be expected that the variance is constant across grades. Such expectations can be formulated as equality and inequality constrained hypotheses on the variances of the students' performances. In this dissertation we develop automatic (or default) Bayes factors for testing such hypotheses. The methods we propose are based on default priors that are specified in an automatic fashion using information from the sample data. Hence, there is no need for the user to manually specify priors under competing (in)equality constrained hypotheses, which is a difficult task in practice. All the user needs to provide is the data and the hypotheses. Our Bayes factors then indicate to what degree the hypotheses are supported by the data and, in particular, which hypothesis receives strongest support.},

  abstract = {In comparing characteristics of independent populations, researchers frequently expect a certain structure of the population variances. These expectations can be formulated as hypotheses with equality and/or inequality constraints on the variances. In this article, we consider the Bayes factor for testing such (in)equality-constrained hypotheses on variances. Application of Bayes factors requires specification of a prior under every hypothesis to be tested. However, specifying subjective priors for variances based on prior information is a difficult task. We therefore consider so-called automatic or default Bayes factors. These methods avoid the need for the user to specify priors by using information from the sample data. We present three automatic Bayes factors for testing variances. The first is a Bayes factor with equal priors on all variances, where the priors are specified automatically using a small share of the information in the sample data. The second is the fractional Bayes factor, where a fraction of the likelihood is used for automatic prior specification. The third is an adjustment of the fractional Bayes factor such that the parsimony of inequality-constrained hypotheses is properly taken into account. The Bayes factors are evaluated by investigating different properties such as information consistency and large sample consistency. Based on this evaluation, it is concluded that the adjusted fractional Bayes factor is generally recommendable for testing equality- and inequality-constrained hypotheses on variances.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Items that ask the respondent for a comment in his/her own\textbackslash{}nwords are becoming increasingly popular in online employee surveys, but\textbackslash{}nresearch on such comments is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to\textbackslash{}nanalyze, theoretically and empirically, what kind of comments are\textbackslash{}ngenerated in employee surveys by respondents who differ in terms of job\textbackslash{}nsatisfaction and commitment.\textbackslash{}nDesign/methodology/approach - The data studied here are from an online\textbackslash{}nemployee survey conducted in 2004 in a multinational IT organization\textbackslash{}nwith a German headquarter. Some 24,000 employees generated about 75,000\textbackslash{}ncomments focusing on 15 topic fields. The comments were additionally\textbackslash{}ncoded on their tone, using a computerized dictionary approach especially\textbackslash{}ndeveloped for this purpose. Frequencies, wordiness, and the tone of\textbackslash{}ndifferent types of comments are measured. The statistical relationship\textbackslash{}nOf comments to job satisfaction and to organizational commitment is\textbackslash{}nanalyzed.\textbackslash{}nFindings - Some 40 per cent of the respondents provide comments. Most\textbackslash{}ncomments have a negative tone. Negative comments are wordier than\textbackslash{}npositive ones. The likelihood of writing comments is inversely related\textbackslash{}nto the respondents' job satisfaction and to their organizational\textbackslash{}ncommitment. Dissatisfied employees and employees with low commitment\textbackslash{}nalso write more negative and wordier comments.\textbackslash{}nPractical implications - The study sets benchmarks on what to expect\textbackslash{}nwhen using open-ended comment fields in employee surveys. A methodology\textbackslash{}nfor analyzing huge text files with respect to their tone is presented.\textbackslash{}nOriginality/value - This is the first paper that investigates a\textbackslash{}nrealistically large data set of comments. It also shows how to use\textbackslash{}ncomputer methods to relate frequencies, wordiness, and tone of comments\textbackslash{}nto standard variables such as job satisfaction or commitment.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates a metatheoretical framework for latent variable modeling. It does so by spelling out the difference between observed and latent variables. This difference is argued to be purely epistemic in nature: We treat a variable as observed when the inference from data structure to variable structure can be made with certainty and as latent when this inference is prone to error. This difference in epistemic accessibility is argued to be directly related to the datagenerating process, i.e., the process that produces the concrete data patterns on which statistical analyses are executed. For a variable to count as observed through a set of data patterns, the relation between variable structure and data structure should be (a) deterministic, (b) causally isolated, and (c) of equivalent cardinality. When any of these requirements is violated, (part of) the variable structure should be considered latent. It is argued that, on these criteria, observed variables are rare to nonexistent in psychology; hence, psychological variables should be considered latent until proven observed.},

  abstract = {The software package Bain (Gu, Mulder, \& Hoijtink, 2017) provides an easy way for researchers to evaluate informative hypotheses with regards to group means. Support in the data for pairs of informative hypotheses is quantified by Bain by computing the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factor (AAFBF). To compute the AAFBF, Bain only needs group mean estimates, their variances and group sample sizes as input. Unfortunately, the common sample mean and its variance are known to be highly susceptible to non-normality and outliers. Therefore, first of all, this paper investigates with a simulation study to what extent the AAFBF resulting from the sample mean and its variance is affected by non-normality and outliers. Furthermore, Bain provides an unique opportunity to combine Bayes factors with robust statistics. Hence, secondly, this paper investigates with a simulation study to what extent the effect of non-normality and outliers can be ameliorated by replacing the sample mean and the corresponding variance estimates by robust estimates, creating the robust Bayes factor AAFBFROB. Results of the simulation studies showed that the performance of the AAFBF decreases when non-normality or outliers are present and that the AAFBFROB is less affected in most instances. An example study is presented to show how the AAFBFROB can be used and instructions how to compute it are provided. Finally, recommendations for researchers as to when use of the AAFBFROB is preferred over use of the AAFBF are given.},

To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first formal evaluation of the use of these variables to facilitate an easier reading of uncertainty in visualizations that rely on line graphical primitives. In addition to blur, dashing and grayscale, we investigate the use of -sketchiness- as a visual variable because it conveys visual impreciseness that may be associated with data quality. Inspired by work in non-photorealistic rendering and by the features of hand-drawn lines, we generate line trajectories that resemble hand-drawn strokes of various levels of proficiency-ranging from child to adult strokes-where the amount of perturbations in the line corresponds to the level of uncertainty in the data. Our results show that sketchiness is a viable alternative for the visualization of uncertainty in lines and is as intuitive as blur; although people subjectively prefer dashing style over blur, grayscale and sketchiness. We discuss advantages and limitations of each technique and conclude with design considerations on how to deploy these visual variables to effectively depict various levels of uncertainty for line marks. \textcopyright{} 1995-2012 IEEE.},

The current research explored the effect of statistical training on college teachers' tendency to over-interpret student evaluation differences. A sample of 225 English, mathematics and psychology teachers evaluated statistical reports of student evaluation data corresponding to a fictional teacher's courses. Teachers from the three disciplines varied significantly in their statistics training, but there were no differences in their tendency to rate small, non-significant differences in student evaluations as indicative of the need to make improvements in a course. These results illustrate that statistical knowledge alone does not prevent the over-interpretation of student evaluation means.},

  abstract = {Using data from the international Teacher Education and Development Study: Learning to Teach Mathematics (TEDS-M), the measurement equivalence of teachers' beliefs across countries is investigated for the case of `mathematics-as-a fixed-ability'. Measurement equivalence is a crucial topic in all international large-scale assessments and widely undervalued for non-achievement measures. Although it is well known that cultural differences may affect response styles or meaning of constructs, and although comparability is often not specifically examined, international large-scale assessment results are typically compared across countries in terms of scale means. Full scalar invariance is typically unattainable in such international assessments due to their sheer size and local item dependence issues. To deal with both challenges, a Bayesian approach is introduced that uses informative priors to define elastic equivalence constraints to investigate the comparability of TEDS-M future teachers' beliefs under a working assumption of approximate measurement invariance. Substantively, a clear pattern of three groups of countries emerged that corroborates preliminary findings in other studies for other teacher beliefs. Future mathematics teachers in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines believed more strongly that mathematics is a fixed ability, whereas the USA, Chile, Norway, Germany and Switzerland believed less strongly in this. Taiwan, Singapore, Poland and Russia took the middle ground. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {In a sample of 135 Norwegian education undergraduates, we examined the effects of topic-specific epistemic beliefs concerning the simplicity and source of knowledge on deep-level understanding of multiple expository texts about the same topic-climate change. The results showed that students holding sophisticated simplicity beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as complex, gained better multiple-text understanding than did students holding na{\"i}ve simplicity beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as simple. However, students holding sophisticated source beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as personal construction, performed poorer than did students holding na{\"i}ve source beliefs, viewing knowledge about climate change as transmitted from experts. Moreover, students believing knowledge to be complex and, simultaneously, relying on expert authors were at a particular advantage with respect to multiple-text understanding. Thus, in this complex reading-task context, source beliefs usually located at the sophisticated ends of epistemic belief continuums turned out to be maladaptive, presumably because they distracted from the building of a high-quality representation of author and text meaning. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The primary aim was to explore and compare the dimensionality of personal epistemology with respect to climate change across the contexts of Norwegian and Spanish students. A second aim was to examine relationships between topic-specific epistemic beliefs and the variables of gender, topic knowledge, and topic interest in the two contexts. Participants were 225 Norwegian and 217 Spanish undergraduates enrolled in psychology or education courses, and the dimensionality of topic-specific personal epistemology was explored through factor analyses of the scores on a 49-item questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to predict scores on the epistemic belief dimensions emerging from the factor analyses with gender, topic knowledge, and topic interest, respectively. Even though considerable cross-cultural generalizability in dimensionality was demonstrated, this research also draws attention to the cultural embeddedness of topic-specific epistemic beliefs. Moreover, differences in the predictability of topic knowledge and topic interest in Norway and Spain, suggest that factors constraining or enhancing adaptive epistemic beliefs concerning particular topics may vary across cultures.

Specifically, there was a negative indirect effect of personal justification on science achievement mediated by science reading comprehension self-efficacy, whereas both justification by authority and justification by multiple sources had positive indirect effects on science achievement mediated by self-efficacy.

Aim: To examine relationships between epistemic cognition concerning the justification of knowledge claims and sourcing and argumentation skills. Sample: Participants were 51 Norwegian undergraduates. Method: Three dimensions of justification were identified in think--aloud protocols based on students' reading of six documents presenting conflicting claims on the controversial scientific issue of cell phone radiation and health risks: justification by authority, personal justification and justification by multiple sources. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the unique predictability of these dimensions for essay performance after removing variance associated with prior knowledge about the topic of the documents. Results: After controlling for topic knowledge, justification by multiple sources uniquely predicted students' sourcing and argumentation in essays that they wrote after reading the documents, with students trying to justify knowledge claims by corroborating across several sources of information more likely to include explicit source citations, link sources and contents, and display better, more integrated argumentation in their essays. Conclusion: Findings are considered in the light of a theoretical framework for multiple--documents literacy adapted to the domain of science, and both theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

  abstract = {To validate an interpretation or use of test scores is to evaluate the plausibility of the claims based on the scores. An argument-based approach to validation suggests that the claims based on the test scores be outlined as an argument that specifies the inferences and supporting assumptions needed to get from test responses to score- based interpretations and uses. Validation then can be thought of as an evaluation of the coherence and completeness of this interpretation/use argument and of the plau- sibility of its inferences and assumptions. In outlining the argument-based approach to validation, this paper makes eight general points. First, it is the proposed score interpretations and uses that are validated and not the test or the test scores. Second, the validity of a proposed interpretation or use depends on how well the evidence supports the claims being made. Third,more-ambitious claims require more support than less-ambitious claims. Fourth, more-ambitious claims (e.g., construct interpre- tations) tend to be more useful than less-ambitious claims, but they are also harder to validate. Fifth, interpretations and uses can change over time in response to new needs and new understandings leading to changes in the evidence needed for valida- tion. Sixth, the evaluation of score uses requires an evaluation of the consequences of the proposed uses; negative consequences can render a score use unacceptable. Seventh, the rejection of a score use does not necessarily invalidate a prior, underly- ing score interpretation. Eighth, the validation of the score interpretation on which a score use is based does not validate the score use.},

This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area.This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once. The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative carries two main goals, (a) to better investigate the linkage between immigration and social policy preferences across countries, and (b) to develop crowdsourcing as a social science method. The Executive Report provides short reviews of the area of social policy preferences and immigration, and the methods and impetus behind crowdsourcing plus a description of the entire project. Three main areas of findings will appear in three papers, that are registered as PAPs or in process.}

For example, more `sophisticated' beliefs are associated with more self-reported monitoring strategies. This relationship is also advocated theoretically. Nevertheless, exactly how and why \{EBs\} impact learning is still an open question. In accordance with others (for example Muis 2007; Muis and Franco 2009) we conceive the \{COPES\} Model (Winne and Hadwin 1998) as an appropriate answer to the how question. Within that model, epistemological beliefs are conceptualized as `internal conditions of learning' and they are embedded into recursive processes of self- regulation. With regard to the why question, we assume that \{EBs\} function as general ideas about knowledge for the apprehension of the content to be learnt. Such apprehension allows for the calibration of learning to different learning tasks. We review two clusters of studies on the preparatory and the enactment stages of learning testing this apprehension and calibration hypothesis.},

Results showed that explanation patterns were influenced by assumptions about not only the tentative nature of knowledge but also about the person of the expert and the institutional practice of science. When trying to resolve the conflict, both groups reported significantly more strategies of evaluating and validating the source rather than assessing the claim's veracity based on their own understanding.

Among these challenges is communicating the effectiveness of an intervention in a way that people untrained in statistics can understand. Use of traditional effect size metrics (e.g., r, r{$^2$}) has been criticized as being confusing to general audiences. In response, researchers have developed nontraditional effect size indicators (e.g., binomial effect size display, common language effect size indicator) with the goal of presenting information in a more understandable manner. The studies described here present the first empirical test of these claims of understandability. Results show that nontraditional effect size indicators are perceived as more understandable and useful than traditional indicators for communicating the effectiveness of an intervention. People also rated training programs as more effective and were willing to pay more for programs whose effectiveness was described using the nontraditional effect size metrics.

  abstract = {Objective: Health literacy and numeracy are necessary to understand health information and to make informed medical decisions. This study explored the relationships among health literacy, numeracy, and ability to accurately interpret graphical representations of breast cancer risk. Methods: Participants (N= 120) were recruited from the Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE) membership. Health literacy and numeracy were assessed. Participants interpreted graphs depicting breast cancer risk, made hypothetical treatment decisions, and rated preference of graphs. Results: Most participants were Caucasian (98\%) and had completed at least one year of college (93\%). Fifty-two percent had breast cancer, 86\% had a family history of breast cancer, and 57\% had a deleterious BRCA gene mutation. Mean health literacy score was 65/66; mean numeracy score was 4/6; and mean graphicacy score was 9/12. Education and numeracy were significantly associated with accurate graph interpretation (r=0.42, p{$<$}0.001 and r=0.65, p{$<$}0.001, respectively). However, after adjusting for numeracy in multivariate linear regression, education added little to the prediction of graphicacy (r2=0.41 versus 0.42, respectively). Conclusion: In our highly health-literate population, numeracy was predictive of graphicacy. Practice implications: Effective risk communication strategies should consider the impact of numeracy on graphicacy and patient understanding. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of "close fit" of a model is suggested.},

As part of the year-long teaching program, students were required to reflect in journal entries on the content of an educational psychology unit in relation to their epistemological beliefs. The students engaged in this teaching program (research group) were interviewed in relation to their beliefs at the beginning (Time 1) and conclusion (Time 2) of the program. Students in a comparison group were not encouraged to explicitly reflect on their epistemological beliefs but completed written statements about their beliefs about knowing at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the year-long unit. M. A. Schommer's (1988, 1990) epistemological beliefs questionnaire was administered to both groups at T1 and T2. This questionnaire measured beliefs about knowing. The results of both the quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicate that the group of students engaged in the teaching program experienced more growth in sophisticated epistemological beliefs. The success of the program has implications for how teacher educators develop learning environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {A teaching program based on relational pedagogy (Baxter Magolda, 1993a) was implemented to foster the development of epistemological beliefs in 29 pre-service teacher education students at a large metropolitan university in Australia. Epistemological beliefs are those personally held beliefs about the nature and structure of knowing. The students were interviewed in relation to their epistemological beliefs at the beginning (Time 1) and conclusion (Time 2) of the teaching program. The results of the qualitative data analysis indicated that students described more sophisticated relational epistemological beliefs over time. This finding is important given that teachers with relativistic epistemological beliefs are more likely to conceive of teaching as a transformative (constructivist) rather than transmissive. The perceived success of the teaching program has implications for the development of a relational teaching model in teacher education courses.},

In particular, they provide a useful framework for investigating learning and teaching for first year students in tertiary education, who are typically considered to hold less sophisticated epistemological beliefs. Using semi-structured interviews, this study investigated the nature of beliefs about knowing and learning of 35 first year teacher education and creative writing students at a large metropolitan university in Australia. The interview analysis indicated that a relationship existed between individuals' core beliefs about knowing and their beliefs about learning. This relationship has implications for the way in which we support first year students' learning as they transition into university and progress through their courses.},

It is shown that the issue of heterogeneity is linked with homogeneity, with different levels within the fields of schooling, and with discursive applications through lines of tension. The term is used above all in the context of socio-cultural categories and in the context of performance heterogeneity. The author criticizes a curtailed and ontologizing understanding of heterogeneity and, conversely, points to the construction of (conceptions of) heterogeneity within the field of schools itself. He pleads for a cultural-theoretical perspective which conceives of heterogeneity not as a , but rather as a process of applying methods of differentiation which can be reconstructed empirically. (DIPF/Orig.).;;Der Beitrag analysiert die Verwendung des Begriffs Heterogenit{\"a}t im schulischen Feld mit dem Ziel, ihn f{\"u}r erziehungswissenschaftliche Schul- und Unterrichtsforschung fruchtbar zu machen. Es wird gezeigt, dass Thematisierungen von Heterogenit{\"a}t in Spannungslinien zu Homogenit{\"a}t, zu unterschiedlichen Ebenen des schulischen Feldes sowie zu diskursiven Eins{\"a}tzen stehen. Verwendung findet der Begriff vor allem im Kontext von soziokulturellen Kategorien sowie von Leistungsheterogenit{\"a}t.

Second, we examine the relationship between epistemological beliefs and learning in order to understand why such beliefs are important to educators. Third, we question whether beliefs about academic knowledge are truly general (i.e., unwavering across academic do- mains) or have a character reflective of the domain to which they are associated (i.e., domain specific).

Using a four-factor model as an initial framework, a series of domain-specific items about mathematics and history was developed. In Study I, these items were administered to 182 undergraduates, and the psychometric properties and underlying factor structure were examined via exploratory factor analysis. In Study II, the modified instrument, the Domain-Specific Beliefs Questionnaire (DSBQ), was administered to 633 students and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. A subsample of participants' responses on the DSBQ was also compared to responses on Schommer's epistemological questionnaire. Study III involved a second confirmatory factor analysis using data from a new sample (n = 523). Those data were examined for potential gender differences. Overall, the results of this investigation suggested that students possess certain domain-specific beliefs about knowledge in mathematics and history. Further, a significant moderate relationship between the DSBQ and Schommer's questionnaire provided some evidence of domain-generality in undergraduates' epistemological beliefs.},

The results indicated that the AD indices were highly correlated with an index of proportional agreement and with within-group inter- rater agreement indices. Study 2, based on survey data collected from 4,158 sales employees in 109 other stores of this company, constructively replicated Study 1 and examined the consistency of interrater agreement decisions across six indices with respect to a priori decision rules. Study 2 results also supported the use of AD indices. Practical issues concerning the use of AD indices for estimating interrater agreement and future research directions are discussed.},

There has been general agreement among researchers about a developmental trajectory of epistemological understanding that takes place in adolescence and adulthood. Rarely has this research included children, however, and we know little about the origins of epistemological awareness or its early development. A separate group of researchers have investigated children's "theory of mind," or the ability to understand others' beliefs, actions, and desires, with primary attention to the onset of this cognitive achievement between the ages of 3 and 5. This article reviews the theoretical foundation for a proposed relation between these constructs, and reports on an exploratory investigation with 3-5 year olds, in which epistemological level was significantly related to theory of mind ability. Results are discussed in relation to a general timeline depicting the development of children's beliefs about knowledge and knowing, a process that involves an ongoing tension between objective and subjective perspectives. We propose that the trajectory of epistemological development be expanded to include an initial period of egocentric subjectivity that characterizes epistemological thinking prior to the achievement of theory of mind. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Background: In recent decades, two lines of research, phenomenographic and meta-cognitive, have examined students' approaches and epistemological beliefs about learning. To date there has been very little research describing the change in epistemological beliefs in European secondary students, or analysing interrelationships between epistemological beliefs and approaches in order to explain their influence on academic performance. Aims: The first aim of this investigation is to analyse the change in epistemological beliefs and learning approaches in secondary students as they progress through their studies. The second aim is to examine the effects of epistemological beliefs on learning approaches, and learning approaches on academic performance. Sample: About 1,600 Spanish students, boys and girls, from several secondary schools took part in the study. They were between 12 and 20 years old and their average age was 14.79 years. Methods: Measures of epistemological beliefs (EQ: Epistemological Questionnaire), learning approaches (LPQ: Learning Process Questionnaire), and academic performance were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the dimensionality of the EQ and LPQ questionnaires. In order to achieve our two aims, different statistical techniques were used: MANOVA and ANOVA for our first aim, and structural equation modelling for our second aim. Results: Throughout secondary education epistemological beliefs undergo change, becoming more realistic and complex, and deep-approach scores decline significantly. It was shown that, as predicted, epistemological beliefs influenced academic achievement directly, and also indirectly via students' learning approaches. Conclusions: Our findings point to two conclusions. First, epistemological beliefs and learning approaches change as pupils advance in their studies. Second, the relationship between epistemological beliefs and academic achievement is mediated by approaches to learning.

We used a survey to investigate ready-to-graduate preservice teachers' beliefs regarding their knowledge and skills in data literacy. Before entering a course on data literacy their belief responses indicated that they had basic data interpretation knowledge, but they were unsure of how to translate that knowledge into the classroom to improve student outcomes. The survey was administered again after a data literacy course, which included a five-week supervised professional experience task of observing data being used in schools to drive pedagogy. The post-course survey responses showed students increased confidence in their ability to interpret and use data, suggesting that a data literacy course linked to the professional experience task improves teachers' sense of preparedness to use data in the classroom.},

Models of role conflict, role ambiguity, time demands, social support, involvement and satisfaction, and work--family conflict were tested using structural equation modeling. Results suggest that social support may be best viewed as an antecedent to perceived stressors, and may reduce perceived role stressors (conflict and ambiguity) and time demands to indirectly decrease work--family conflict. Individuals who develop strong social support networks at work and at home may perceive fewer stressors in organizational and family life.

  abstract = {Propensity score analysis is a method that equates treatment and control groups on a comprehensive set of measured confounders in observational (nonrandomized) studies. A successful propensity score analysis reduces bias in the estimate of the average treatment effect in a nonrandomized study, making the estimate more comparable with that obtained from a randomized experiment. This article reviews and discusses an important practical issue in propensity analysis, in which the baseline covariates (potential confounders) and the outcome have missing values (incompletely observed). We review the statistical theory of propensity score analysis and estimation methods for propensity scores with incompletely observed covariates. Traditional logistic regression and modern machine learning methods (e.g., random forests, generalized boosted modeling) as estimation methods for incompletely observed covariates are reviewed. Balance diagnostics and equating methods for incompletely observed covariates are briefly described. Using an empirical example, the propensity score estimation methods for incompletely observed covariates are illustrated and compared. In the prototypical observational study, participants are mea-sured on a set of covariates at baseline (pretreatment), they then receive a treatment or control intervention, and, finally, one or more outcome variables are measured (Rosenbaum, 2010). Given nonrandom assignment to treatment (t) or control (c) groups, there are typically baseline covariates that are common causes of the assignment to t versus c and the outcome variable. These variables are termed confounders. Lack of proper statistical adjustment for confounders will produce a biased estimate of the causal effect in an observational study. To equate the t and c groups at baseline, Rubin (2001) has recom-mended that a comprehensive set of covariates that are potential confounders be measured because the actual confounders are un-known. Moser, West, and Hughes (2012) measured 72 covariates in a study comparing the subsequent academic achievement of children who were retained in first grade (t group) or promoted to second grade (c group) at the end of their first school year. West et al. (2014) measured 98 covariates in a study investigating the well-being of patients who received versus those who did not receive telephone counseling. Traditional exact matching methods will fail when more than a few covariates are measured because appropriate matches cannot be created (see Chapin, 1947, for an example). Traditional analysis of covariance may produce inappropriate results if there are nonlinear covariate-outcome relationships and the baseline distribu-tions of the covariates of the two groups do not fully overlap (Schafer \& Kang, 2008). Propensity score analysis, originally developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), can be used to equate the distributions of a large number of measured covariates in the t and c groups, producing a less biased estimate of the causal effect. Comprehensive reviews of the use of propensity score analysis with complete data are available (In practice, the measured covariates (putative confounders) and out-come often have missing values. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no comprehensive review of methods for addressing these prob-lems in propensity score analysis. This is the primary goal of the present article. The structure of the article is as follows. First, we briefly review of the theory of propensity scores when the covariates are com-pletely observed, followed by a presentation of the theory for incompletely observed covariates. Second, we consider methods of estimating propensity scores, beginning with the traditional logis-tic regression method followed by newer machine learning meth-ods. Machine learning methods, often used with big data sets, can make correct predictions (here, of the propensity score for treat-ment assignment) without specifying each of the covariates and their relationship to the outcome. Third, we discuss balance diag-nostics, equating methods, and sensitivity analysis for incomplete covariates. Fourth, we present an illustrative example that applies these methods to an empirical data set with incompletely observed covariates. Fifth, we discuss propensity score analysis when the outcome variable has missing values. Finally, we discuss other issues in propensity score analysis with covariates having missing data. Our focus in this article is on the prototypical observational study in which the participants are nonrandomly assigned to t or c and whose goal is to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome variable Y.},

The result is similar to that found by M. Schommer with North American university students in that the number of dimensions is the same but the nature of the dimensions is different. The paper hypothesizes that these differences can be accounted for in terms of differences in cultural context. In particular, the difference in dimensions concerned with authority--expert knowledge and effort and learning reported in this study might be explained by value differences between Western (North American) and non-Western (Hong Kong Chinese) culture. From a methodological perspective, the interview data (from 23 of the above students) also imply difficulties in measuring knowledge beliefs and one finding from the study is that in-depth interviews to complement quantitative data are necessary for trustworthy study of epistemological beliefs.

The results on epistemological beliefs were somewhat different from Schommer's findings with North American college students and reflected the influence of cultural contexts. The two teaching and learning conceptions were labelled Traditional and Constructivist Conceptions. Pearson correlation analysis showed significant relations between Innate/Fixed Ability, Authority/Expert Knowledge and Certainty Knowledge with Traditional Conception and Learning Effort/Process with Constructivist Conception. Confirmatory factor analysis also showed the possible causal effect of epistemological beliefs on conceptions about teaching and learning. All these analyses tended to support the suggested views in literature that teachers' conceptions about teaching and learning are beliefs driven.

A review of the literature  has shown that think-aloud research methods have a sound theoretical  basis and provide a valid source of data about participant thinking,  especially during language based activities.  However, a researcher  needs to design a process which takes into account a number of concerns,  by selecting a suitable task, a role for the researcher, a source of  triangulation, and, most importantly, an appropriate method of  interpretation.  This paper argues that think-aloud research can be  effectively interpreted through a qualitative lens.  A qualitative  approach also has implications for the choice of participant(s) and the  treatment of the data.

Several hypotheses are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation models, including two structural equation models with several misspecifications of each model. Results suggested several unique findings. First, increasing numbers of omitted paths in the measurement model were associated with decreasing numbers of improper solutions. Second, bias in the parameter estimates was higher in samples with improper solutions than in samples including only proper solutions. Third, investigations of the consequences of using constrained estimates in the presence of improper solutions indicated that inequality constraints helped some samples achieve convergence. Finally, the use of confidence intervals as well as four other proposed tests yielded similar results when testing whether the error variance was greater than or equal to zero.},

A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs ({$\increment$}GFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using {$\increment$}comparative fit index,{$\increment$}Gammahat, and{$\increment$}McDonald's Noncentrality Index to eval- uate measurement invariance.

In the study, 120 undergraduate students in an educational technology course participated as part of their coursework. Using a wiki, triads reciprocally asked and responded to questions as constructing either a group summary or a group argument. Students with less advanced epistemological beliefs more actively coordinated formats and procedures for group work and achieved higher comprehension of reading materials in the collaborative summary than in the collaborative argumentation. By contrast, these differences were not found for students with more advanced epistemological beliefs. However, the interaction effect between tasks and epistemological beliefs disappeared for the quality of argumentation on case problems. Independently of epistemological beliefs, collaborative argumentation promoted more constructive and interactive peer questioning activities and helped to construct higher quality arguments in case problems than collaborative summary. Therefore, the effects of matching tasks and epistemological beliefs varied depending on types of learning outcomes (comprehension vs. argumentation) in online peer questioning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, 116--131) and examined the implications of this personality variable relative to smartphone use. The results based on the survey data (N = 411) provided support for our hypotheses that NFC is an important motivational personality construct that distinguishes between adopters and non-adopters of smartphones. We also found that NFC moderates the linkages between instrumental beliefs, social influence factors, and behavioural intentions (BI). Specifically, perceived usefulness had a stronger effect on BI for high-NFC people, whereas perceived ease of use and subjective norms had stronger effects for low-NFC people. The findings reveal possible important variations in technology adoption and the role of NFC in governing these alternative decision-making processes. Implications for theory, product design, as well as for managers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {This book describes ggplot2, a new data visualization package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing computational and cognitive tools for making data preparation, visualization, and analysis easier. He has developed 15 R packages and in 2006 he won the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work on the ggplot and reshape R packages.},

  abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

  abstract = {One of the central lessons from research on data use in schools and school districts is that assess- ments, student tests, and other forms of data are only as good as how they are used. But what influences how they are used? This relatively straightforward question turns out to be fairly com- plex to answer. Data use implicates a number of processes, conditions, and contexts. It involves interpretive processes, as using data requires that the user interpret the data and construct implica- tions for next steps. It implicates social and organizational conditions, since the data use unfolds in the context of a multileveled organizational system. And, because data can be a source of power, particularly in the current accountability environment, data use also involves power relations. In this article, we put forward a framework for understanding the phenomenon of data use in the context of data use interventions. We draw on existing research and theory to identify key dimensions of data use that we should attend to and offer a way to understand how these dimensions might interact. In so doing, we provide guidance for studying the pathways between data use interventions and various outcomes of value.},

These categories were reinforced through triangulation with data from focus group dialogues. The findings suggest relationships between previous cross-cultural experiences, gender, and beliefs.

The study was correlational with an ethnically diverse sample of 187 fifth grade students (46\% Latino, 27\% Anglo, and 27\% African American, and 67\% low SES). Self-report questionnaires that tapped four dimensions of beliefs (source, certainty, development, and justification) were given to students at two time points during the course of a nine-week science unit. Results showed that students became more sophisticated in their beliefs about source and certainty of knowledge over time, but that there were no reliable changes in development and justification. There also were no main or moderating effects of gender or ethnicity, but there were main effects of SES and achievement. Low SES and low achieving children had less sophisticated beliefs in comparison to average SES and high achieving children. There were no significant interactions between gender, ethnicity, SES, and achievement for any of the four belief measures. Results are discussed in terms of personal and contextual factors and their role in the facilitation of epistemological belief development.},

This paper presents instructional design considerations providing empirical evidence and integrating theoretical concepts related to cognitive load. Learners have a limited working memory, and instructional representations should be designed with the goal of reducing unnecessary cognitive load. However, cognitive architecture alone is not the only factor to be considered; individual differences, especially prior knowledge, are critical in deter- mining what impact a visual representation will have on learners' cognitive structures and processes. Prior knowledge can determine the ease with which learners can perceive and interpret visual representations in working memory. Although a long tradition of research has compared experts and novices, more research is necessary to fully explore the expert\textendash{} C novice continuum and maximize the potential of visual representations. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper investigates drawbacks with this standard encoding, and considers a set of alternatives designed to more effectively communicate the implications of mean and error data to a general audience, drawing from lessons learned from the use of visual statistics in the information visualization community. We present a series of crowd-sourced experiments that confirm that the encoding of mean and error significantly changes how viewers make decisions about uncertain data. Careful consideration of design tradeoffs in the visual presentation of data results in human reasoning that is more consistently aligned with statistical inferences. We suggest the use of gradient plots (which use transparency to encode uncertainty) and violin plots (which use width) as better alternatives for inferential tasks than bar charts with error bars.},

Network approaches motivate alternative ways of analyzing data, and suggest new ways of modeling and simulating personality processes. In the present paper, we provide an overview of network analysis strategies as they apply to personality data. We discuss different ways to construct networks from typical personality data, show how to compute and interpret important measures of centrality and clustering, and illustrate how one can simulate on networks to mimic personality processes. All analyses are illustrated using a data set on the commonly used HEXACO questionnaire using elementary R-code that readers may easily adapt to apply to their own data.},

Nachgezeichnet werden {\"A}nderungen {\"u}ber drei Erhebungszeitpunkte (zu Studienbeginn, nach dem dritten Semester, nach Studienabschluss). Im l{\"a}ngsschnittlichen Verlauf zeigt sich eine abnehmende Bedeutsamkeitszuschreibung an die bildungswissenschaftliche Komponente - sie wird bereits nach dem dritten Semester als am unbedeutsamsten erachtet, und auch die korrespondierende Qualit{\"a}ts- und Nutzenseinsch{\"a}tzung ist vergleichsweise gering.

(DIPF/Orig.).;;On the basis of a longitudinal study, the author examines the assessment of the significance, quality and usefulness of educational-scientific study courses during the first phase of teacher training as given by students enrolled in teacher training in Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg (focal point: university of education). Changes are recorded by carrying out three surveys at different points in time (at the beginning of the studies, after the third semester, after graduation). The longitudinal data show that the educational-scientific component is attributed increasingly less significance - after just three semesters it is already considered the most insignificant of all components, and the corresponding assessment of its quality and usefulness, too, is comparatively low. This relative disdain continues up to after graduation. These findings are discussed and reasons for the decrease in significance are revealed by means of a panel analysis. (DIPF/Orig.).},

Folge dieses deskriptiven Befundes sind intensivierte Bem{\"u}hungen um Pr{\"a}vention und Intervention sowie stigmatisierende Zuschreibungen an die Klientel der Lehrkr{\"a}fte. Weitgehend offen ist bislang, ob die starke psychische Ersch{\"o}pfung tats{\"a}chlich ein Lehramtsspezifikum darstellt und wie diese erkl{\"a}rt werden kann. Der Beitrag analysiert daher die psychische Ersch{\"o}pfung von Lehrkr{\"a}ften im repr{\"a}sentativen Berufsgruppenvergleich deskriptiv und zeigt regressionsanalytisch proximale Pr{\"a}diktoren auf. Grundlage sind Daten aus den BIBB/ BAuA-Erwerbst{\"a}tigenbefragungen 2006 und 2012. Die psychische Ersch{\"o}pfung von Lehrkr{\"a}ften ist im Vergleich zu sonstigen Erwerbst{\"a}tigen auff{\"a}llig hoch, unterscheidet sich aber nicht von Angeh{\"o}rigen anderer sozialer Berufe. Starke psychische Ersch{\"o}pfung unter Lehrkr{\"a}ften l{\"a}sst sich insbesondere durch hohe qualitative Arbeitsbelastung sowie geringe Arbeitszufriedenheit prognostizieren. Ein Berufsgruppeneffekt ist nach zus{\"a}tzlicher Kontrolle von sozialer Unterst{\"u}tzung und L{\"a}rmbelastung nicht mehr nachweisbar, weshalb psychische Ersch{\"o}pfung nicht l{\"a}nger als Spezifikum des Lehrerberufs gelten kann. Ungeachtet dessen ist die qualitative Arbeitsbelastung im Lehramt signifikant h{\"o}her als in anderen (auch sozialen) Berufen. (DIPF/Orig.)},

They propose 7 rules of eye to guide the inferential use of figures with error bars. These include general principles: Seek bars that relate directly to effects of interest, be sensitive to experimental design, and interpret the intervals. They also include guidelines for inferential interpretation of the overlap of CIs on independent group means. Wider use of interval estimation in psychology has the potential to improve research communication substantially.},

This relationship is one in which the public must trust the advice of health experts, even if that advice is not always readily understood or judged to be agreeable. However, it will be argued in this article that the pact of trust between public health workers and members of the public has been steadily eroded over many years. The reasons for this erosion are examined as are attempts to characterize the concept of trust in empirical studies. The discussion then considers how a so-called informal fallacy, known as the "argument from authority," might contribute to attempts to understand the trust relationship between the public and health experts. Specifically, this argument enables the lay person to bridge gaps in knowledge and arrive at judgements about public health problems by attending to certain logical and epistemic features of expertise. The extent to which lay people are able to discern these features is considered by examining the results of a study of public health reasoning in 879 members of the public.},

  author = {Dablander, Fabian},
  year = {2019},

  abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. In this blog post, I provide an introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference in the tradition of Sewell Wright, Judea Pearl, and others.  We first rehash the common adage that correlation is not causation. We then move on to climb what Pearl calls the ``ladder of causal inference'', from association (seeing) to intervention (doing) to counterfactuals (imagining). We will discover how directed acyclic graphs describe conditional (in)dependencies; how the do-calculus describes interventions; and how Structural Causal Models allow us to imagine what could have been. This blog post is by no means exhaustive, but should give you a first appreciation of the concepts that surround causal inference; references to further readings are provided below. Let's dive in!1  Correlation and Causation Messerli (2012) published a paper entitled ``Chocolate Consumption, Cognitive Function, and Nobel Laureates'' in The New England Journal of Medicine showing a strong positive relationship between chocolate consumption and the number of Nobel Laureates. I have found an even stronger relationship using updated data2, as visualized in the figure below.               Now, except for people in the chocolate business, it would be quite a stretch to suggest that increasing chocolate consumption would increase the number Nobel Laureates. Correlation does not imply causation because it does not constrain the possible causal relations enough. Hans Reichenbach (1956) formulated the common cause principle which speaks to this fact:     If two random variables \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are statistically dependent (\$X \textbackslash{}perp Y\$), then either (a) \$X\$ causes \$Y\$, (b) \$Y\$ causes \$X\$, or (c) there exists a third variable \$Z\$ that causes both \$X\$ and \$Y\$. Further, \$X\$ and \$Y\$ become independent given \$Z\$, i.e., \$X \textbackslash{}perp Y \textbackslash{}mid Z\$.   An in principle straightforward way to break this uncertainty is to conduct an experiment: we could, for example, force the citizens of Austria to consume more chocolate, and study whether this increases the number of Nobel laureates in the following years. Such experiments are clearly unfeasible, but even in less extreme settings it is frequently unethical, impractical, or impossible \textemdash{} think of smoking and lung cancer \textemdash{} to study an association experimentally.  Causal inference provides us with tools that license causal statements even in the absence of a true experiment. This comes with strong assumptions. In the next section, we discuss the ``causal hierarchy''.  The Causal Hierarchy Pearl (2019a) introduces a causal hierarchy with three levels \textemdash{} association, intervention, and counterfactuals \textemdash{} as well as three prototypical actions corresponding to each level \textemdash{} seeing, doing, and imagining. In the remainder of this blog post, we will tackle each level in turn.  Seeing Association is on the most basic level; it makes us see that two or more things are somehow related. Importantly, we need to distinguish between marginal associations and conditional associations. The latter are the key building block of causal inference. The figure below illustrates these two concepts.    If we look at the whole, aggregated data on the left we see that the continuous variables \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are positively correlated: an increase in values for \$X\$ co-occurs with an increase in values for \$Y\$. This relation describes the marginal association of \$X\$ and \$Y\$ because we do not care whether \$Z = 0\$ or \$Z = 1\$. On the other hand, if we condition on the binary variable \$Z\$, we find that there is no relation: \$X \textbackslash{}perp Y \textbackslash{}mid Z\$. (For more on marginal and conditional associations in the case of Gaussian distributions, see this blog post). In the next section, we discuss a powerful tool that allows us to visualize such dependencies.  Directed Acyclic Graphs We can visualize the statistical dependencies between the three variables using a graph. A graph is a mathematical object that consists of nodes and edges. In the case of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), these edges are directed. We take our variables \$(X, Y, Z\$) to be nodes in such DAG and we draw (or omit) edges between these nodes so that the conditional (in)dependence structure in the data is reflected in the graph. We will explain this more formally shortly. For now, let's focus on the relationship between the three variables. We have seen that \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are marginally dependent but conditionally independent given \$Z\$. It turns out that we can draw three DAGs that encode this fact; these are the first three DAGs in the figure below. \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are dependent through \$Z\$ in these graphs, and conditioning on \$Z\$ blocks the path between \$X\$ and \$Y\$. We state this more formally shortly.        While it is natural to interpret the arrows causally, we do not do so here. For now, the arrows are merely tools that help us describe associations between variables.  The figure above also shows a fourth DAG, which encodes a different set of conditional (in)dependence relations between \$X\$, \$Y\$, and \$Z\$. The figure below illustrates this: looking at the aggregated data we do not find a relation between \$X\$ and \$Y\$ \textemdash{} they are marginally independent \textemdash{} but we do find one when looking at the disaggregated data \textemdash{} \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are conditionally dependent given \$Z\$.    A real-world example might help build intuition: Looking at people who are single and who are in a relationship as a separate group, being attractive (\$X\$) and being intelligent (\$Y\$) are two independent traits. This is what we see in the left panel in the figure above. Let's make the reasonable assumption that both being attractive and being intelligent are positively related with being in a relationship. What does this imply? First, it implies that, on average, single people are less attractive and less intelligent (see red data points). Second, and perhaps counter-intuitively, it implies that in the population of single people (and people in a relationship, respectively), being attractive and being intelligent are negatively correlated. After all, if the handsome person you met at the bar were also intelligent, then he would most likely be in a relationship!  In this example, visualized in the fourth DAG, \$Z\$ is commonly called a collider. Suppose we want to estimate the association between \$X\$ and \$Y\$ in the whole population. Conditioning on a collider (for example, by only analyzing data from people who are not in a relationship) while computing the association between \$X\$ and \$Y\$ will lead to a different estimate, and the induced bias is known as collider bias. It is a serious issue not only in dating, but also for example in medicine.  The simple graphs shown above are the building blocks of more complicated graphs. In the next section, we describe a tool that can help us find (conditional) independencies between sets of variables.3    \$d\$-separation For large graphs, it is not obvious how to conclude that two nodes are (conditionally) independent. d-separation is a tool that allows us to check this algorithmically. We need to define some concepts:   A path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$ is a sequence of nodes and edges such that the start and end nodes are \$X\$ and \$Y\$, respectively.   A conditioning set \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ is the set of nodes we condition on (it can be empty).   A collider along a path blocks that path. However, conditioning on a collider (or any of its descendants) unblocks that path.  With these definitions out of the way, we call two nodes \$X\$ and \$Y\$ \$d\$-separated by \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ if conditioning on all members in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ blocks all paths between the two nodes.  If this is your first encounter with \$d\$-separation, then this is a lot to wrap your head around. To get some practice, look at the graph on the left side. First, note that there are no marginal dependencies; this means that without conditioning or blocking nodes, any two nodes are connected by a path. For example, there is a path going from \$X\$ to \$Y\$ through \$Z\$, and there is a path from \$V\$ to \$U\$ going through \$Y\$ and \$W\$.          However, there are a number of conditional independencies. For example, \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are conditionally independent given \$Z\$. Why? There are two paths from \$X\$ to \$Y\$: one through \$Z\$ and one through \$W\$. However, since \$W\$ is a collider on the path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$, the path is already blocked. The only unblocked path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$ is through \$Z\$, and conditioning on it therefore blocks all remaining open paths. Additionally conditioning on \$W\$ would unblock one path, and \$X\$ and \$Y\$ would again be associated.  So far, we have implicitly assumed that conditional (in)dependencies in the graph correspond to conditional (in)dependencies between variables. We make this assumption explicit now. In particular, note that d-separation provides us with an independence model \$\textbackslash{}perp\_\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{G\}\}\$ defined on graphs. To connect this to our standard probabilistic independence model \$\textbackslash{}perp\_\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{P\}\}\$ defined on random variables, we assume the following Markov property:  In words, we assume that if the nodes \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are d-separated by \$Z\$ in the graph \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{G\}\$, the corresponding random variables \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are conditionally independent given \$Z\$. This implies that all conditional independencies in the data are represented in the graph.4 Moreover, the statement above implies (and is implied by) the following factorization:  where \$\textbackslash{}text\{pa\}\^\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{G\}\}(X\_i)\$ denotes the parents of the node \$X\_i\$ in graph \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{G\}\$ (see Peters, Janzing, \& Sch{\"o}lkopf, p. 101). A node is a parent of another node if it has an outgoing arrow to that node; for example, \$X\$ is a parent of \$Z\$ and \$W\$ in the graph above. The above factorization implies that a node \$X\$ is independent of its non-descendants given its parents.  d-separation is an extremely powerful tool. Until now, however, we have only looked at DAGs to visualize (conditional) independencies. In the next section, we go beyond seeing to doing.  Doing We do not merely want to see the world, but also change it. From this section on, we are willing to interpret DAGs causally. As Dawid (2009a) warns, this is a serious step. In merely describing conditional independencies \textemdash{} seeing \textemdash{} the arrows in the DAG played a somewhat minor role, being nothing but ``incidental construction features supporting the \$d\$-separation semantics'' (Dawid, 2009a, p. 66). In this section, we endow the DAG with a causal meaning and interpret the arrows as denoting direct causal effects.  What is a causal effect? Following Pearl and others, we take an interventionist position and say that a variable \$X\$ has a causal influence on \$Y\$ if changing \$X\$ leads to changes in \$Y\$. This position is a very useful one in practice, but not everybody agrees with it (e.g., Cartwright, 2007).  The figure below shows the observational DAGs from above (top row) as well as the manipulated DAGs (bottom row) where we have intervened on the variable \$X\$, that is, set the value of the random variable \$X\$ to a constant \$x\$. Note that setting the value of \$X\$ cuts all incoming causal arrows since its value is thereby determined only by the intervention, not by any other factors.        As is easily verified with \$d\$-separation, the first three graphs in the top row encode the same conditional independence structure. This implies that we cannot distinguish them using only observational data. Interpreting the edges causally, however, we see that the DAGs have a starkly different interpretation. The bottom row makes this apparent by showing the result of an intervention on \$X\$. In the leftmost causal DAG, \$Z\$ is on the causal path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$, and intervening on \$X\$ therefore influences \$Y\$ through \$Z\$. In the DAG next, to it \$Z\$ is on the causal path from \$Y\$ to \$X\$, and so intervening on \$X\$ does not influence \$Y\$. In the third DAG, \$Z\$ is a common cause and \textemdash{} since there is no other path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$ \textemdash{} intervening on \$X\$ does not influence \$Y\$. For the collider structure in the rightmost DAG, intervening on \$X\$ does not influence \$Y\$ because there is no unblocked path from \$X\$ to \$Y\$.  To make the distinction between seeing and doing, Pearl introduced the do-operator. While \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid X = x)\$ denotes the observational distribution, which corresponds to the process of seeing, \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$ corresponds to the interventional distribution, which corresponds to the process of doing. The former describes what values \$Y\$ would likely take on when \$X\$ happened to be \$x\$, while the latter describes what values \$Y\$ would likely take on when \$X\$ would be set to \$x\$.  Computing causal effects \$P(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$ describes the causal effect of \$X\$ on \$Y\$, but how do we compute it? Actually doing the intervention might be unfeasible or unethical \textemdash{} side-stepping actual interventions and still getting at causal effects is the whole point of this approach to causal inference. We want to learn causal effects from observational data, and so all we have is the observational DAG. The causal quantity, however, is defined on the manipulated DAG. We need to build a bridge between the observational DAG and the manipulated DAG, and we do this by making two assumptions.  First, we assume that interventions are local. This means that if I set \$X = x\$, then this only influences the variable \$X\$, with no other direct influence on any other variable. Of course, intervening on \$X\$ will influence other variables, but only through \$X\$, not directly through us intervening. In colloquial terms, we do not have a ``fat hand'', but act like a surgeon precisely targeting only a very specific part of the DAG; we say that the DAG is composed of modular parts. We can encode this using the factorization property above:  which we now interpret causally. The factors in the product are sometimes called causal Markov kernels; they constitute the modular parts of the system.  Second, we assume that the mechanism by which variables interact do not change through interventions; that is, the mechanism by which a cause brings about its effects does not change whether this occurs naturally or by intervention (see e.g., Pearl, Glymour, \& Jewell, p. 56).  With these two assumptions in hand, further note that \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$ can be understood as the observational distribution in the manipulated DAG \textemdash{} \$p\_m(Y \textbackslash{}mid X = x)\$ \textemdash{} that is, the DAG where we set \$X = x\$. This is because after doing the intervention (which catapults us into the manipulated DAG), all that is left for us to do is to see its effect.  Observe that the leftmost and rightmost DAG above remain the same under intervention on \$X\$, and so the interventional distribution \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$ is just the conditional distribution \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid X = x)\$. The middle DAGs require a bit more work:  The first equality follows by definition. The second and third equality follow from the sum and product rule of probability. The last line follows from the assumption that the mechanism through which \$X\$ influences \$Y\$ is independent of whether we set \$X\$ or whether \$X\$ naturally occurs, that is,  \$p\_\{m\}(Y = y \textbackslash{}mid X = x, Z = z) = p(Y = y \textbackslash{}mid X = x, Z = z)\$, and the assumption that interventions are local, that is, \$p\_m(Z = z) = p(Z = z)\$. Thus, the interventional distribution we care about is equal to the conditional distribution of \$Y\$ given \$X\$ when we adjust for \$Z\$. Graphically speaking, this blocks the path \$X \textbackslash{}leftarrow Z \textbackslash{}leftarrow Y\$ in the left middle graph and the path \$X \textbackslash{}leftarrow Z \textbackslash{}rightarrow Y\$ in the right middle graph. If there were a path \$X \textbackslash{}rightarrow Y\$ in these two latter graphs, and if we would not adjust for \$Z\$, then the causal effect of \$X\$ on \$Y\$ would be confounded. For these simple DAGs, however, it is already clear from the fact that \$X\$ is independent of \$Y\$ given \$Z\$ that \$X\$ cannot have a causal effect on \$Y\$. In the next section, study a more complicated graph and look at confounding more closely.  Confounding Confounding has been given various definitions over the decades, but usually denotes the situation where a (possibly unobserved) common cause obscures the causal relationship between two or more variables. Here, we are slightly more precise and call a causal effect of \$X\$ on \$Y\$ confounded if \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid X = x) \textbackslash{}neq p(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$, which also implies that collider bias is a type of confounding. This occured in the middle two DAGs in the example above, as well as in the chocolate consumption and Nobel Laureates example at the beginning of the blog post. Confounding is the bane of observational data analysis. Helpfully, causal DAGs provide us with a tool to describe multivariate relations between variables. Once we have stated our assumptions clearly, the do-calculus further provides us with a means to know what variables we need to adjust for so that causal effects are unconfounded.  We follow Pearl, Glymour, \& Jewell (2016, p. 61) and define the backdoor criterion:     Given two nodes \$X\$ and \$Y\$, an adjustment set \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ fulfills the backdoor criterion if no member in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ is a descendant of \$X\$ and members in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ block all paths between \$X\$ and \$Y\$. Adjusting for \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{L\}\$ thus yields the causal effect of \$X \textbackslash{}rightarrow Y\$.   The key observation is that this (a) blocks all spurious, that is, non-causal paths between \$X\$ and \$Y\$, (b) leaves all directed paths from \$X\$ to \$Y\$ unblocked, and (c) creates no spurious paths.          To see this action, let's again look at the DAG on the left. The causal effect of \$Z\$ on \$U\$ is confounded by \$X\$, because in addition to the legitimate causal path \$Z \textbackslash{}rightarrow Y \textbackslash{}rightarrow W \textbackslash{}rightarrow U\$, there is also an unblocked path \$Z \textbackslash{}leftarrow X \textbackslash{}rightarrow W \textbackslash{}rightarrow U\$ which confounds the causal effect. The backdoor criterion would have us condition on \$X\$, which blocks the spurious path and renders the causal effect of \$Z\$ on \$U\$ unconfounded. Note that conditioning on \$W\$ would also block this spurious path; however, it would also block the causal path \$Z \textbackslash{}rightarrow Y \textbackslash{}rightarrow W \textbackslash{}rightarrow U\$.  Before moving on, let's catch a quick breath. We have already discussed a number of very important concepts. At the lowest level of the causal hierarchy \textemdash{} association \textemdash{} we have discovered DAGs and \$d\$-separation as a powerful tool to reason about conditional (in)dependencies between variables. Moving to intervention, the second level of the causal hierarchy, we have satisfied our need to interpret the arrows in a DAG causally. Doing so required strong assumptions, but it allowed us to go beyond seeing and model the outcome of interventions. This hopefully clarified the notion of confounding. In particular, collider bias is a type of confounding, which has important practical implications: we should not blindly enter all variables into a regression in order to ``control'' for them, but think carefully about what the underlying causal DAG could look like. Otherwise, we might induce spurious associations.  The concepts from causal inference can help us understand methodological phenomena that have been discussed for decades. In the next section, we apply the concepts we have seen so far to make sense of one such phenomenon: Simpson's Paradox.  Example Application: Simpson's Paradox This section follows the example given in Pearl, Glymour, \& Jewell (2016, Ch. 1) with slight modifications. Suppose you observe \$N = 700\$ patients who either choose to take a drug or not; note that this is not a randomized control trial. The table below shows the number of recovered patients split across sex.        We observe that more men as well as more women recover when taking the drug (93\% and 73\%) compared to when not taking the drug (87\% and 69\%). And yet, when taken together, fewer patients who took the drug recovered (78\%) compared to patients who did not take the drug (83\%). This is puzzling \textemdash{} should a doctor prescribe the drug or not?  To answer this question, we need to compute the causal effect that taking the drug has on the probability of recovery. As a first step, we draw the causal DAG. Suppose we know that women are more likely to take the drug, that being a woman has an effect on recovery more generally, and that the drug has an effect on recovery. Moreover, we know that the treatment cannot cause sex. This is a trivial yet crucial observation \textemdash{} it is impossible to express this in purely statistical language. Causal DAGs provide us with a tool to make such an assumption explicit; the graph below makes explicit that sex (\$S\$) is a common cause of both drug taking (\$D\$) and recovery (\$R\$). We denote \$S = 1\$ as being female, \$D = 1\$ as having chosen the drug, and \$R = 1\$ as having recovered. The left DAG is observational, while the right DAG indicates the intervention \$do(D = d)\$, where \$d\$ denotes taking the drug (\$d = 0\$) or not taking the drug (\$d = 1\$).        We are interested in the probability of recovery if we would force everybody to take, or not take, the drug; we call the difference between these two probabilities the average causal effect. This is key: the do-operator is about populations, not individuals. Using it, we cannot make statements that pertain to the recovery of an individual patient; we can only refer to the probability of recovery as defined on populations of patients. We will discuss individual causal effects in the section on counterfactuals at the end of the blog post.  Computing the average causal effect requires knowledge about the interventional distributions \$p(R \textbackslash{}mid do(D = 0))\$ and \$p(R \textbackslash{}mid do(D = 1))\$. As discussed above, these correspond to the conditional distribution in the manipulated DAG which is shown above on the right. The backdoor criterion tells us that the conditional distribution in the observational DAG will correspond to the interventional distribution when blocking the spurious path \$D \textbackslash{}leftarrow S \textbackslash{}rightarrow R\$. Using the adjustment formula we have derived above, we expand:  In words, we first compute the benefit of taking the drug separately for men and women, and then we average the result by weighting it with the fraction of men and women in the population. This tells us that, if we force everybody to take the drug, about \$82\textbackslash\%\$ of people will recover. We can similarly compute the probability of recovery given we force all patients to not choose the drug:  Therefore, taking the drug does indeed have a positive effect on recovery on average, and the doctor should prescribe the drug.  Note that this conclusion heavily depended on the causal graph. While graphs are wonderful tools in that they make our assumptions explicit, these assumptions are \textemdash{} of course \textemdash{} not at all guaranteed to be correct. These assumptions are strong, stating that the graph must encode all causal relations between variables, and that there is no unmeasured confounding, something we can never guarantee in observational data.  Let's look at a different example but with the exact same data. In particular, instead of the variable sex we look at the post-treatment variable blood pressure. This means we have measured blood pressure after the patients have taken the drug. Should a doctor prescribe the drug or not?        Since blood pressure is a post-treatment variable, it cannot influence a patient's decision to take the drug or not. We draw the following causal DAG, which makes clear that the drug has an indirect effect on recovery through blood pressure, in addition to having a direct causal effect.5        From this DAG, we find that the causal effect of \$D\$ on \$R\$ is unconfounded. Therefore, the two causal quantities of interest are given by:  This means that the drug is indeed harmful. In the general population (combined data), the drug has a negative effect. Suppose that the drug has a direct positive effect on recovery, but an indirect negative effect through blood pressure. If we only look at patients with a particular blood pressure, then only the drug's positive effect on recovery remains. However, since the drug does influence recovery negatively through blood pressure, it would be misleading to take the association between \$D\$ and \$R\$ conditional on \$Z\$ as our estimate for the causal effect. In contrast to the previous example, using the aggregate data is the correct way to analyze these data in order to estimate the average causal effect.  So far, our treatment has been entirely model-agnostic. In the next section, we discuss Structural Causal Models (SCM) as the fundamental building block of causal inference. This will unify the previous two levels of the causal hierarchy \textemdash{} seeing and doing \textemdash{} as well as open up the third and final level: counterfactuals.  Structural Causal Models In this section, we discuss Structural Causal Models (SCM) as the fundamental building block of causal inference. SCMs relate causal and probabilistic statements. As an example, we specify:  \$X\$ is a direct cause of \$Y\$ which it influences through the function \$f()\$, and the noise variables \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_X\$ and \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_Y\$ are assumed to be independent. In a SCM, we take each equation to be a causal statement, and we stress this by using the assignment symbol \$:=\$ instead of the equality sign \$=\$. Note that this is in stark contrast to standard regression models; here, we explicitly state our causal assumptions.  As we will see below, Structural Causal Models imply observational distributions (seeing), interventional distributions (doing), as well as counterfactuals (imagining). Thus, they can be seen as the fundamental building block of this approach to causal inference. In the following, we restrict the class of Structural Causal Models by allowing only linear relationships between variables and assuming independent Gaussian error terms.6 As an example, take the following SCM (Peters, Janzing, \& Sch{\"o}lkopf, 2017, p. 90):  where \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_X, \textbackslash{}epsilon\_Y \textbackslash{}stackrel\{\textbackslash{}text\{iid\}\}\{\textbackslash{}sim\} \textbackslash{}mathcal\{N\}(0, 1)\$ and \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_Z \textbackslash{}stackrel\{\textbackslash{}text\{iid\}\}\{\textbackslash{}sim\} \textbackslash{}mathcal\{N\}(0, 0.1)\$. Again, each line explicates the causal link variables. For example, we assume that \$X\$ has a direct causal effect on \$Y\$, that this effect is linear, and that it is obscured by independent Gaussian noise.  The assumption of Gaussian errors induces a multivariate Gaussian distribution on \$(X, Y, Z)\$ whose independence structure is visualized in the leftmost DAG below. The middle DAG shows an intervention on \$Z\$, while the rightmost DAG shows an intervention on \$X\$. Recall that, as discussed above, intervening on a variable cuts all incoming arrows.        At the first level of the causal hierarchy \textemdash{} association \textemdash{} we might ask ourselves: does \$X\$ or \$Z\$ predict \$Y\$ better? To illustrate the answer for our example, we simulate \$n = 1000\$ observations from the Structural Causal model:  set.seed(1)   n       Answering the question of whether a particular patient would have recovered more quickly had we given him the treatment even though we did not give him the treatment seems almost fantastical. It is a cross-world statement: given what we have observed, we ask about what would have been if things had turned out different. It may strike you as a bit eerie to speak about different worlds. Peters, Janzing, \& Sch{\"o}lkopf (2017, p. 106) state that it is ``debatable whether this additional [counterfactual] information [encoded in the SCM] is useful.'' It certainly requires strong assumptions. More broadly, Dawid (2000) argues in favour of causal inference without counterfactuals, and he does not seem to have shifted his position in recent years. Yet if we want to design machines that can achieve human level reasoning, we need to endow them with counterfactual thinking (Pearl, 2019a). Moreover, many concepts that a relevant in legal and ethical domains, such as fairness (Kusner et al., 2017), require counterfactuals.  Before we end, note that the graphical approach to causal inference outlined in this blog post is not the only game in town. The potential outcome framework for causal inference developed by Donald Rubin and others avoids graphical models and takes counterfactual quantities as primary. However, although starting from counterfactual statements that are defined at the individual level, it is my understand that most work that uses potential outcomes focuses on average causal effects. As outlined above, this only requires the second level of the causal hierarchy \textemdash{} doing \textemdash{} and are therefore much less contentious than individual causal effects, which sit at the top of the causal hierarchy.  The graphical approach outlined in this blog post and the potential outcome framework are logically equivalent (Peters, Janzing, \& Sch{\"o}lkopf, 2017, p. 125), and although there is quite some debate surrounding the two approaches, it is probably wise to be pragmatic and simply choose the tool that works best for a particular application. As Lauritzen (2004, p. 189) put it, he sees the     ``different formalisms as different `languages'. The French language may be best for making love whereas the Italian may be more suitable for singing, but both are indeed possible, and I have no difficulty accepting that potential responses, structural equations, and graphical models coexist as languages expressing causal concepts each with their virtues and vices.9''   For further reading, I wholeheartedly recommend the textbooks by Pearl, Glymour, \& Jewell (2016) as well as Peters, Janzing, \& Sch{\"o}lkopf (2017). For bedtime reading, I can recommend Pearl \& McKenzie (2018). Miguel Hern{\'a}n teaches an excellent introductory online course on causal diagrams here.  Conclusion In this blog post, we have touched on several key concepts of causal inference. We have started with the puzzling observation that chocolate consumption and the number of Nobel Laureates are strongly positively related. At the lowest level of the causal ladder \textemdash{} association \textemdash{} we have seen how directed acyclic graphs can help us visualize conditional independencies, and how d-separation provides us with an algorithmic tool to check such independencies.  Moving up to the second level \textemdash{} intervention \textemdash{} we have seen how the do-operator models populations under interventions. This helped us define confounding \textemdash{} the bane of observational data analysis \textemdash{} as occuring when \$p(Y \textbackslash{}mid X = x) \textbackslash{}neq p(Y \textbackslash{}mid do(X = x))\$. This comes with the important observation that entering all variables into a regression in order to ``control'' for them is misguided; rather, we need to carefully think about the underlying causal relations lest we want to introduce bias by for example conditioning on a collider. The backdoor criterion provided us with a graphical way to assess whether an effect is confounded or not.  Finally, we have seen that Structural Causal Models (SCMs) provide the building block from which observational and interventional distributions follow. SCMs further imply counterfactual statements, which sit at the top of the causal hierarchy. These allow us to move beyond the do-operator and average causal effects: they enable us to answer questions about what would have been if things had been different.

The data I present here are somewhat different. I include Nobel Laureates up to 2019, and I use the 2017 chocolate consumption data as reported here. You can download the data set here). To get the data reported by Messerli (2012) into R, you can follow this blogpost.~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 I can recommend this course on causal diagrams by Miguel Hern{\'a}n to get more intuition for causal graphical models.~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 If the converse implication, that is, the implication from the distribution to the graph holds we say that the graph is faithful to the distribution. This is an important assumption in causal learning, because it allows one to estimate causal relations from conditional independencies in the data.~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 A causal effect is direct only at at particular level of abstraction. The drug works by inducing certain biochemical reactions that might themselves be described by DAGs. On a finer scale, then, the direct effect seizes to be direct.~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 Structural Causal Models are closely related to Structural Equation Models. The latter allow latent variables, but they causal content has been debated throughout the last century. For more information, see for example Pearl (2012) and Bollen \& Pearl (2013).~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 For the interpretation of the do-operator for non-manipulable causes, see Pearl (2019b).~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 Here, we have focused on deterministic counterfactuals, which assign a single value to the counterfactual \$R\_\{T = 1\}(\textbackslash{}epsilon\_1)\$. This is in contrast to stochastic or non-deterministic counterfactuals, which follow a distribution. This distinction does not matter for average causal effects, but it does for individual ones (Hern{\'a}n \& Robins, 2020, p. 10).~{$\hookleftarrow$}                 One can only hope that Bayesians and Frequentists become inspired by the pragmatism expressed here so poetically by Lauritzen.~{$\hookleftarrow$}},

Only 39 of 162 outcome studies featured specified procedures for the documentation of fidelity. Of these, only 13 considered variations in integrity in analyzing the effects of the program. Lowered adherence to protocol was often associated with poorer outcome. There was mixed evidence of dosage effects. The omission of integrity data, particularly measures of adherence, may compromise the internal validity of outcome studies in the prevention literature. We do not view procedures for integrity verification as inconsistent with the adaptation of interventions to the needs of receiving communities.},

The effective use of data requires that teachers develop the knowledge and skills to analyze and use data to improve instruction. The purpose of this article is to examine teachers' capacity for and beliefs about data use. These issues are examined through a review of research in the past decade. We find that teachers' beliefs about and capacity for data use are often not connected within the literature or in practice, but we argue they are the heart of the connection between data and instructional change. Teachers' capacity to use data and their beliefs about data use are shaped within their professional communities, in training sessions, and in their interactions with coaches, consultants, and principals. However, efforts to develop teachers' capacity for data use often fall short of their goals. Correspondingly, teachers have varied beliefs about data use, and some feel they lack the ability to use data to inform instruction. In order to be more successful, capacity building should directly address teachers' beliefs, and data use must be decoupled from external accountability demands and involve a variety of information on student learning.},

  abstract = {Data-driven decision making continues to be a common feature of educational reform agendas across the globe. In many U.S. schools, the teacher team meeting is a key setting in which data use is intended to take place, with the aim of planning instruction to address students' needs. However, most prior research has not examined how the use of data shapes teachers' dialogue about their students' ability and achievement. Purpose: This study examines how teachers talk about student ability and achievement in the era of data-driven decision making and how their talk is shaped by the use of data within teams, their school contexts, and broader accountability systems. Research Design: The study draws on interview and observational data gathered from teacher teams in four elementary schools. In each of these schools, teachers were expected to use data to inform instructional differentiation. Data collection efforts involved regular visits to each school over the course of one year to interview teachers and conduct observations of teacher team meetings. In the process of analysis, interview transcripts and field notes were coded, and themes were extracted within and across codes. Findings: Across schools, teachers used common labels (e.g., "low," "middle," "GATE") to describe students of different achievement levels and the programs they were involved in. The use of labels and student categories was relational and comparative and influenced by the accountability and policy contexts in which teachers worked. At the same time, regular meetings in which teachers jointly examined data on student learning provided a space for teachers to examine students' strengths and weaknesses on a variety of measures and talk in terms of student growth. Teachers questioned whether assessment data provided an accurate picture of student achievement and acknowledged the role of student effort, behavior, and family circumstances as important factors that were not easily measured. These discussions opened up deeper inquiry into the factors that supported or hindered student learning. The implementation of the Common Core State Standards also led some teachers to question prior categorizations of student ability. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings from this study suggest that educational reforms and policies regarding data use influence educators' conceptions of student achievement and ability. On the one hand, accountability policies can narrow the dialogue about students. On the other hand, educational reforms and policies could also lead to new ways of thinking about student learning and to an examination of a broader range of data, and provide opportunities for professional learning.},

Also, it is examined whether these value orientations are differently and uniquely related to general and specific beliefs and behavioral intention. Results provide support for the reliability and validity of the value instrument. All studies replicated the distinction into three value orientations, with sufficient internal consistency. Furthermore, when altruistic and biospheric goals conflict, they seem to provide a distinct basis for proenvironmental intentions. The value instrument could therefore be useful to better understand relationships between values, beliefs, and intentions related to environmentally significant behavior.},

Latent class transition analyses were conducted to determine the stability and change of latent class membership across two time points. For both baseline and follow-up measures, latent class analyses suggested that two latent classes were most appropriate for characterizing the youths using the four domains of risk factors. One class reflected youths reporting few problems in any risk area; the second class reflected youths reporting problems in many of the risk domains. The latent class transition analyses indicated that about two thirds of the youths experienced similar problems over time. The results emphasize the heterogeneity of this study's sample.

Different types of support were provided to the first three groups of schools in order to help them establish SSE mechanisms, whereas no SSE mechanism was established in any of the schools of the fourth group. In the first group, school stakeholders were offered the opportunity to develop their own SSE mechanisms and design their own improvement strategies. The second group followed the same process in designing SSE mechanisms as the first, but before introducing this approach support was offered to the stakeholders in order to address and reduce their concerns about SSE. The third group was asked to develop SSE mechanisms and take decisions for their improvement strategies which were in line with the knowledge base of educational effectiveness research. All three experimental groups had better results than the control group, but the impact of the third approach on student achievement was higher than the impact of the other two approaches to SSE. Implications for research on SSE are drawn.},

This cross-cultural study analyzed the relationship between homework time and mathematics achievement drawing on data from 231,759 students in 9,791 schools and 40 countries who participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003. Multilevel analyses found a positive association between school-average homework time and mathematics achievement in almost all countries, but the size of the association decreased considerably once socioeconomic background and school track were controlled. At the student level, no clear-cut relationship was established between homework time and achievement across the 40 countries. The results highlight the need to use multilevel analyses and to control for confounding variables in homework research. (Contains 7 tables, 2 figures, and 4 notes.)},

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory's predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intu-itions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-sig-nificant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, con-versely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be eviden-tially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

The three approaches are evaluated in two distinct situations: Heywood cases caused by lack of fit and misspecification error, and Heywood cases induced from sampling fluctuations. The results indicate that in the case of sampling fluctuations the simple approach of setting the offending estimate to zero works reasonably well. In the case of lack of fit and misspecification error, the theoretical difficulties that give rise to negative error variance estimates have no ready-made methodological solutions.

If hidden causes can intervene to generate bad (or good) outcomes, then a rational observer will assign blame (or credit) to these hidden causes, rather than to the stable outcome distribution. Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how causal attributions contribute to biased learning.},

Questionnaires were used to measure beliefs, paper-and-pencil based achievement tests to measure knowledge, and a video-based test to measure perception and planning abilities. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that prospective preschool teachers' mathematics-related beliefs can be distinguished into a static, a process, and an application orientation. Structural equation modeling revealed that an application orientation and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge can predict the ability to perceive mathematical learning situations and to plan adequate actions.

According to conceptual change theory, learners sometimes hold knowledge, feelings, and beliefs that may be counterproductive to acquiring new knowledge, as a result addressing those variables is crucial to the learning process. Research on teachers suggests they often hold views that make them reluctant to learn more about or engage in DDDM (e.g.), but by tailoring instruction to address teacher concerns, they may become more open to DDDM (Airola \& Dunn, 2011). Our qualitative analysis and findings indicated our sample of preservice teachers did overwhelmingly hold initially negative views of DDDM, but our persuasive instructional unit created a cognitive shift away from this negativity and towards openness to and interest in DDDM.},

  abstract = {To help inform drug abuse prevention research in school settings about the issues surrounding implementation, we conducted a review of the fidelity of implementation research literature spanning a 25-year period. Fidelity has been measured in five ways: (1) adherence, (2) dose, (3) quality of program delivery, (4) participant responsiveness and (5) program differentiation. Definitions and measures of fidelity were found not to be consistent across studies, and new definitions are proposed. While there has been limited research on fidelity of implementation in the social sciences, research in drug abuse prevention provides evidence that poor implementation is likely to result in a loss of program effectiveness. Studies indicate that most teachers do not cover everything in a curriculum, they are likely to teach less over time and training alone is not sufficient to ensure fidelity of implementation. Key elements of high fidelity include teacher training, program characteristics, teacher characteristics and organizational characteristics. The review concludes with a discussion of the tension between fidelity and reinvention/adaptation, and ways of resolving this tension. Recommendations are made for developing a consistent methodology for measuring and analyzing fidelity of implementation. Further, researchers and providers should collaborate to develop ways of introducing flexibility into prevention programs.},

To succeed in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world, it is vital that schools grow, develop, adapt and take charge of change so that they can control their own futures.This paper will examine the tension that exists for school leaders in relation to data about their schools and their students, arguing that the explicit connections between data and large-scale reforms make it impossible to avoid a critical approach to data, drawing on research in Ontario and Manitoba in Canada, and examining parallels with evidence from research in England, to highlight the challenges involved in using data effectively in different political contexts and mandated policies on the uses of data.},

Data teams consist of teachers and members of the school leadership team, who collaboratively analyze and use data to solve an education-related problem at the school. This mixed-methods study aims at measuring the effects of working in a data team on the application of data use in ten secondary schools by using questionnaires and case study interviews. The results show that at the end of the intervention period, educators on the data teams did not apply data use more often for accountability actions, but seemed to be more aware of data use for school development and instruction. Furthermore, it seemed that the teachers made a start at applying data use for instructional actions.},

However, schools struggle with the implementation of data use, because building human capacity around data use in education has not received enough attention. Educators urgently need to develop data literacy skills for being able to use data. For supporting schools with the endeavor of developing data literacy skills, we developed and implemented a data use intervention in secondary schools based in the Netherlands. This study therefore focuses on the effects of this intervention on educator satisfaction with the intervention and their data literacy skills and attitude toward data use. This study uses a quasi-experimental research design and employs a mixed-methods approach with a data use questionnaire filled in by data team schools (N = 9) and comparison schools (N = 42), a satisfaction questionnaire filled in by data team participants (N = 55), pre- and posttest knowledge tests filled in by data team participants (N = 36), and interview data (N = 11) from three case study schools. The results show that the participants were, for example, very satisfied with the support received during the intervention. Also, respondents developed new data literacy skills and showed a more positive attitude toward data use. The results show how teachers can be supported systematically in data use in their educational practice. In the conclusions, we discuss some important implications for practice regarding the intensity and duration of support and implications for further research.},

  pages = {554--567},
  doi = {10.1002/sce.1023},
  abstract = {Among researchers who study students' epistemologies, a consensus has emerged about what constitutes a sophisticated stance toward scientific knowledge. Ac- cording to this community consensus, students should understand scientific knowledge as tentative and evolving, rather than certain and unchanging; subjectively tied to scientists' perspectives, rather than objectively inherent in nature; and individually or socially con- structed, rather than discovered. Surveys, interview protocols, and other methods used to probe students' beliefs about scientific knowledge broadly reflect this outlook. This arti- cle questions the community consensus about epistemological sophistication. We do not suggest that scientific knowledge is objective and fixed; if forced to choose whether knowl- edge is certain or tentative, with no opportunity to elaborate, we would choose ``tentative.'' Instead, our critique consists of two lines of argument. First, the literature fails to distin- guish between the correctness and productivity of an epistemological belief. For instance, elementary school students who believe that science is about discovering objective truths to questions, such as whether the earth is round or flat, or whether an asteroid led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, may be more likely to succeed in science than students who believe science is about telling stories that vary with one's perspective. Na\textasciidieresis{} \i{}ve realism, al- though incorrect (according to a broad consensus of philosophers and social scientists), may nonetheless be productive for helping those students learn. Second, according to the con- sensus viewas reflected in commonly used surveys, epistemological sophistication consists of believing certain blanket generalizations about the nature of knowledge and learning, generalizations that do not attend to context. These generalizations are neither correct nor productive. For example, it would be unsophisticated for students to view as tentative the idea that the earth is round rather than flat. By contrast, they should take a more tenta- tive stance toward theories of mass extinction. Nonetheless, many surveys and interview protocols tally students as sophisticated not for attending to these contextual nuances, but C for subscribing broadly to the viewthat knowledge is tentative.},

Patients with this disorder do not complete personally relevant tasks in time or not at all, or only under extreme pressure. Common treatment approaches combine various elements from psycho-educative and cognitive-behavioral interventions. In contrast, we present an approach focusing mainly on restricting working time as a treatment method for procrastination. Patients are allowed to work only during certain time windows and only for a set amount of time. Only by increasing their working efficiency, i.e. by utilizing the previously allotted working time as efficiently as possible, they can earn more working time. Restricting the working time leads to a change of perspective from 'I have to study (continuously)' to 'I am allowed to study (right now)'. This short intervention of only 5 sessions can be delivered in a group setting or in an individual setting. Here, we will present its application within a group setting. An evaluation of restricting working time as a group intervention produced convincing effect sizes in the self-assessment instruments as well as with respect to daily study and working behavior assessed via an online working diary.

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on posttraumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

In the context of these reforms, the aim of this research is to consider the question of the relationship between the theoretical and the practical education of pedagogues at the university level. Eleven university professors from departments of pedagogy and andragogy at the universities of Ljubljana and Belgrade were interviewed. The semi-structured interviews focused on two main research questions: 1) how they understand the relationship between pedagogical theory and practice, and the identity of pedagogy as a science in that context, and 2) their opinion about the competence-based approach in the context of the study of pedagogy. The findings show that the majority of the interviewed university teachers hold an opinion that pedagogy is primarily a theoretical (reflective) science and, accordingly, that the mastery of theory is crucial for the development of pedagogues' competences. Furthermore, most of them are rather reserved and critical of the competence approach as well as of the practical skills development. Although there are some differences in opinions between the professors from Ljubljana and Belgrade, this study shows that similar discourses pre-vail. The gap between pedagogical theory and practice is one of the major issues that have been current in pedagogical science in the recent decades. The findings of our research indicate that there is dissatisfaction with the relationship between modern pedagogical theory and practice, accompanied by the need for its reconceptualization.

In this study, we examine factors affecting the interpretation of CBM data. Specifically, we examine the effect of CBM graph patterns on ease of graph interpretation. Thirty college/university students completed a two-part study in which they viewed various slope-to-goal and slope-to-slope patterns of CBM-graphed data and answered decision-making questions. Response times and accuracy were measured. Results revealed that graph patterns differed in terms of ease of interpretation. Differences depended on the type of question. Implications for interpretation and use of CBM data for decision-making are discussed.},

This assumption was tested by comparing beliefs about scientific research on psychological and biological development. Undergraduates from the United States and the United Kingdom responded to a set of epistemologically relevant statements about each field and then compared the two fields directly in terms of their confidence in the conclusions and advice of experts. On all measures, more negative beliefs were expressed about research on psychological development. Although U.S. students were more skeptical about both fields, U.S. and U.K. students displayed similar response patterns. To justify their skepticism toward scientific research as a valid source of knowledge about psychological development, students in both countries gave similar reasons (e.g., the difficulty in accurately measuring psychological variables). These results demonstrate that epistemological beliefs can differ substantially between two closely related fields. They also highlight issues that must be addressed to make education about the validity of research in developmental psychology more effective. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This guide is for readers who want to make rich
inferences from their data. It does not contain anything new with regard to R code
or theoretical development, but it does piece together information in an easy
to follow guide. An article was recently published in a journal that is
probably not well known by most researchers, Multivariate Behavioral
Research, where the authors discuss the theoretical background of Bayesian
inference and provide a simple web calculator for linear regression (Rouder \&amp; Morey, 2012; http://pcl.missouri.edu/bf-reg).
More recently, R code has been developed (Morey, Rouder,
\&amp; Jamil, 2015) and compiled to conduct many different types of Bayesian
analyses (Morey, 2015; http://bayesfactorpcl.r-forge.r-project.org/). However, this leaves information scattered
across websites and journal pages, and so it is not easily taken in by a
researcher who doesn't know where to start with either Bayesian theory or R
software. This guide has been put together in a way that a researcher who has
never used Bayesian inference or R software could conduct, report, and interpret
a Bayesian linear regression. It skips over the complicated derivations and
mathematics behind the theory, and focuses on why Bayes factors are valuable
and desirable to researchers. It then shows step-by-step how R software can be
used for Bayesian model comparison as well as parameter estimation in linear
regression problems.},

  abstract = {\{\textbackslash{}dq\}The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.\{\textbackslash{}dq\}--Publisher's description.},

Second, students' perceptions do not differ according to their age. Third, we found that there was a significant difference between the perceptions of male and female students in respect of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, but not in respect of personal accomplishment. Fourth, according to the students' perceptions, a considerable percentage of variance in each of the three burnout dimensions was explained by teachers' competence to cope with student disruptive behaviour and perceived disruptive student behaviour.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The contribution examines theoretical foundations, factorial structure, and predictive power of student ratings of teaching quality. Three basic dimensions of teaching quality have previously been described: classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate. However, student ratings, especially those provided by primary school students, have been criticised for being biased by factors such as teacher popularity. The present study examines ratings of teaching quality and science learning among third graders. Results of multilevel confirmatory factor analyses (N=1556 students, 89 classes) indicate that the three-dimensional model of teaching quality can be replicated in ratings of third graders. In a longitudinal study (N=1070 students, 54 classes), we found ratings of classroom management to predict student achievement, and ratings of cognitive activation and supportive climate to predict students' development of subject-related interest after teacher popularity is controlled for. The analyses show that student ratings can be useful measures of teaching quality in primary school. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigated conditions and consequences of teacher popularity in primary schools. Teacher popularity is embedded in a theoretical framework that describes relationships between teacher competence, teaching quality, and student outcomes. In the empirical analyses, we used multilevel modeling to distinguish between individual students' liking of the teacher and a teacher's popularity as rated by the whole class (N = 1070 students, 54 teachers). The classroom level composite of the extent to which students liked their teacher was a reliable indicator of teacher popularity. Teacher popularity was associated with teacher self-reports of self- efficacy and teaching enthusiasm and with external observers' ratings of teaching quality. The grades students received were not related to the popularity ratings. In a longitudinal study, teacher popularity predicted students' learning gains and interest development over and above the effects of teaching quality. These results suggest that teacher popularity can be a useful and informative indicator in research on stu- dents' academic development and teacher effectiveness.},

Using simulation data, the authors first examine whether there is any empirical evidence for the use of a universal cutoff, and then compare the practice of using the point estimate of the RMSEA alone versus that of using it jointly with its related confidence interval. The results of the study demonstrate that there is little empirical support for the use of .05 or any other value as universal cutoff values to determine adequate model fit, regardless of whether the point estimate is used alone or jointly with the confidence interval. The authors' analyses suggest that to achieve a certain level of power or Type I error rate, the choice of cutoff values depends on model specifications, degrees of freedom, and sample size.},

Accuracy and speed of processing were compared for six different presentation formats: pie charts, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, systematic ovals, and random ovals. Quantities were used in two tasks: a choice task that required larger/smaller judgments and an estimate task that required more precise evaluation. The impacts of blue-yellow color and of a treatment-decision context on performance in the two tasks were also investigated. The study included four experiments. Taken together the results suggest that the formats best for making a choice differ from those best for estimating the size of an amount. For making a choice, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, and systematic ovals were equally well perceived; pie charts and random ovals caused slower and less accurate performances. For estimating, numbers led to the most accurate estimates, followed by systematic ovals. The other four formats led to the least accurate estimates.

On each trial, participants saw 2 percentages (in 1 format) and were asked to choose the larger chance of survival or the smaller chance of side effects. Outcomes were errors and RT. Formats were either black and white or blue and yellow; background color was either white or blue. Participants were 216 volunteers from the community older than 50 years.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: Formats with a number produced the same relative errors and relative RT as the formats with a number and scale. Formats with only a scale, however, shifted relative performance: Errors increased with more difficult formats (pie charts and random ovals by 3\%-4\% v. approximately 1\% with other formats), but RT decreased with easier formats (vertical bars, horizontal bars, and systematic ovals decreased 100-200 ms v. an increase of 0-300 ms with other formats). Vertical bars with scales were the fastest and most accurately processed. Neither foreground nor background color had any impact on either outcome.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: For supporting older people's judgments of relative extent, risk information is best presented using vertical bars with a scale; the format systematic ovals with a scale are among the next most easily processed.},

Tenth-graders responded to questionnaires assessing beliefs concerning the justification of knowledge claims in science and the certainty/simplicity of knowledge about a particular scientific issue. Students in an experimental group, who read multiple conflicting documents concerning the issue of sun exposure and health, changed their domain-specific beliefs concerning personal justification and justification by multiple sources as well as their topic-specific beliefs concerning the certainty/simplicity of knowledge, whereas no such changes were observed in a control group, reading multiple consistent documents on the same issue. Moreover, students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group on a measure of multiple-documents comprehension.

Nonetheless, when this effect is analyzed in detail there are inconsistent, and in some cases, contradictory results. The central aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of homework on performance of students in mathematics and science using multilevel models. The original sample consisted of 7,725 Spanish adolescents with a mean age of 13.78 ({$\pm$}0.82) of which 7,451 were evaluated after purging the sample of the students who did little to no homework. A 2-level hierarchical-linear analysis was performed, student and class, with 4 individual adjustment variables: gender, socioeconomic and cultural level, year repetition, and school grades, which were used to reflect previous student achievement. The individual level examined time spent, effort made, and the way homework was done. The class level considered frequency of assignment and quantity of homework. Prior knowledge, estimated using school grades, is shown to be the most important predictor of achievement in the study. Its effect is greater than the combined effect of all the other variables studied. Once background factors are controlled, the homework variables with most impact on the test are student autonomy and frequency of homework assignment by teachers. Autonomy when doing homework was shown to be the most important individual-level variable in both mathematics and science, and not effort and or time spent doing homework. The optimum duration of homework was found to be 1 hr a day. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Most theoretical and applied work has employed first-order growth models, in which a single manifest variable serves as indicator of trait level at each time of measurement. In the current paper, we concentrate on issues regarding second-order growth models, which have multiple indicators at each time of measurement. With multiple indicators, tests of factorial invariance of parameters across times of measurement can be tested. We conduct such tests using two sets of data, which differ in the extent to which factorial invariance holds, and evaluate longitudinal confirmatory factor, latent growth curve, and latent difference score models. We demonstrate that, if factorial invariance fails to hold, choice of indicator used to identify the latent variable can have substantial influences on the characterization of patterns of growth, strong enough to alter conclusions about growth. We also discuss matters related to the scaling of growth factors and conclude with recommendations for practice and for future research.},

As a result, early on in their school career, elementary school students are exposed to a diversity of knowledge and skills explained to them by their teachers, systematized in curricula and syllabi, and conveyed through instruction, school books, and other educational materials. The goal of this chapter is to consider how the actual nature of the knowledge and skills to be learned is portrayed and perceived in elementary classrooms. That is, how is the nature of knowledge and knowing presented by teachers, instruction, and educational materials? From an educational perspective, is knowledge conveyed as black-and-white, stripped from its complexity and ambiguity, and assessed in a right-or-wrong fashion? From a more disciplinary perspective, are different ways of knowing along with their characteristic subjectivities and tentativeness acknowledged by teachers, instruction, and educational materials? Correspondingly, what are the beliefs of elementary school students about knowledge and knowing and are their epistemic beliefs influenced by (such) common classroom components? Do elementary students believe in the objectivity of knowledge and the existence of absolute truth? Or do they think of knowledge as being more delicate and subject to change? Taking all of these different classroom components and influences into consideration, the overarching questions of this chapter include: what is the epistemic climate of elementary classrooms, what does it look like, and what is its possible educational potential?

This article uses item response theory to simulate dichotomous item-level data to assess the robustness of KR-20 (a), v, and test\textendash{}retest under varying selection ratios. These estimators, both corrected and uncorrected for range restriction, were compared in terms of both bias and precision. Test\textendash{}retest reliability was usually the best estimator of reliability across a variety of conditions. Only under indirect range restriction did KR-20 and v performed well.

This study empirically illuminates the persistence of long-standing challenges regarding the relevance, accessibility, and usability of research in colleges of education housed in research-intensive universities. While KMSE holds promise for expanding the reach and impact of educational research, scholarly tensions underlying these trends suggest that individual and organizational efforts will suffice only with modifications to university procedures for identifying what counts as recognizable, assessable, and rewardable scholarly products and activities for faculty careers.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The perspective that teaching requires doing \{\textbackslash{}dq\}whatever it takes,\{\textbackslash{}dq\} knowledge about a variety of topics, and the ability to use knowledge in multiple ways and settings, suggests that teaching is a very complex task. Thus, the beliefs that underscore this perspective on teaching must be equally complex. In this chapter we explore how preservice and practicing teachers articulate their beliefs about teaching knowledge. By teaching knowledge we mean any knowledge used to facilitate the practice of teaching. Several theorists, including Shulman (1987), Elbaz (1983), and Grossman (1990) have attempted to articulate the knowledge base for teaching. That is, what is it that teachers know that allows them to be successful in facilitating student learning? Although these two strands of research, teachers' beliefs and teachers' knowledge, have added greatly to our understanding of teaching and learning, the lack of overlap between these fields is surprising. For instance, studies of preservice teacher beliefs about knowledge have tended to address their general knowledge beliefs (e.g., Ravindran et al, 2005), focused on their beliefs about knowledge in specific academic domain (e.g., mathematics: Gill et al, 2004), or examined the domain generality-specificity of teachers' knowledge (e.g., Olafson and Schraw, 2006). Discussions of teacher knowledge rarely query teachers about the knowledge that they need for teaching and few probe teachers' beliefs about the nature of such knowledge. To address this issue, we have undertaken an examination of teachers' beliefs that spans these fields of study and connects to the existing literature on students' knowledge beliefs (Buehl and Fives, 2009; Fives and Buehl, 2005; Fives and Buehl, 2008). In this work, we have developed a framework for understanding teachers' beliefs that is grounded in previous research yet reflective of the perspectives held by preservice and practicing teachers. Through our examination of their responses and attempts to develop a framework that integrates the voices of teachers with the research literature, we have come to realize the complexity of these beliefs. Herein, we overview our framework, which is the culmination of several studies, and highlight critical methodological issues that have arisen for us in our attempts to understand these beliefs. We also acknowledge the current theoretical and empirical literature that has influenced our thinking and we relate our emergent framework back to this literature.

  abstract = {Beliefs refer to propositions that are considered to be true. Teachers' beliefs refer largely to the beliefs teachers hold that are relevant to their teaching practice. Teachers hold beliefs about a myriad of things, as do all humans. However, specific beliefs about teaching, learning, and students seem to play a particular role in teachers' practices and willingness to engage in professional learning opportunities. Teachers' beliefs are relevant for issues in teacher education such as motivation for teaching, instructional practices, classroom management, and assessment activities. Beliefs that preservice and practicing teachers bring to professional learning experiences influence how and what is learned in those experiences and ultimately what is put into practice. To understand what is meant by the construct of teachers' beliefs, one must consider the variation in definitions and the need for construct clarification. Any investigation into teachers' beliefs must account for two fundamental aspects of this construct: the nature of belief as a construct and the content of belief under construction. By nature of belief, we refer to how the construct of belief is defined and understood, in particular the stance that researchers take with regard to the relationship between knowledge and beliefs. Belief content refers to what the belief is specifically about, such as general beliefs about teaching, learning, students, or more specific beliefs about an instructional practice (e.g., cooperative learning), classroom assessment, and diverse student groups. Without a clear conceptual understanding of the beliefs investigated, understanding empirical findings and drawing implications for practice may be misguided.
            Four themes frame the scholarship on teachers' beliefs: (1) conceptualizing teachers' beliefs, (2) teachers' beliefs and teachers' practice, (3) development of teachers' beliefs, and (4) changing teachers' beliefs. Teacher educators should consider the importance of teacher beliefs on teacher learning when designing and implementing learning experiences for preservice and in-service teachers. Specifically, teacher educators need to provide opportunities for teachers to reveal their beliefs, attend to identity and emotion with beliefs, and support belief enactment. A key finding across the field is the need to consider the whole teacher when examining teachers' beliefs and facilitating change or development in them; that is, teachers' emotions, identity, career stage, life stages, and the myriad of beliefs they hold about a variety of topics all influence how beliefs are aligned and enacted (or not) in practice.},

This puts pressure on them from several sides and may be an influential factor that leads them to tailor their teaching to students' preferences. The aim of this study was to investigate teachers' perceptions of student feedback and how it affects their teaching choices. A survey was sent out to all teachers at the School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The study found that student feedback is perceived positively by university teachers, has a large impact on their teaching and helps improve courses. Student feedback pushes teaching in the direction of fewer lectures and more tutorials, seminars and case studies. Teachers receiving negative student feedback experience more negative feelings related to the feedback, and are also more likely to introduce unjustified changes to their teaching in order to please students. These teachers also tend to have less teaching experience. However, a very large majority of teachers have a high level of professional pride and integrity and do not make (as they perceive them) unjustified changes to their teaching.},

A theoretically appropriate method fits the CFA model to polychoric correlations using either weighted least squares (WLS) or robust WLS. Importantly, this approach assumes that a continuous, normal latent process determines each observed variable. The extent to which violations of this assumption undermine CFA estimation is not well-known. In this article, the authors empirically study this issue using a computer simulation study. The results suggest that estimation of polychoric correlations is robust to modest violations of underlying normality. Further, WLS performed adequately only at the largest sample size but led to substantial estimation difficulties with smaller samples. Finally, robust WLS performed well across all conditions.},

In higher education, students often struggle with understanding the underlying logic of SQL, thus have trouble with understanding how and why a result table is created from a query. A prototype of a visual learning tool for SQL, viSQLizer, has been developed to determine if visualizations could help students create a mental model and thus enhance their understanding of the underlying logic of SQL. Trough the use of animations and decomposing, our results indicate that visualizations might give students a better understanding of the underlying logic, and that students gain the same learning outcome through visualizations as when using a online tutorial with explanatory text and exercises. Feedback from both professors and students from conducted interviews and experiments indicate that the tool could be used by professors as a visualization tool in lectures, and by students as an practical tool; not as a replacement of but as an addition to traditional teaching methods.},

Results revealed that when individuals' epistemic beliefs were consistent with the knowledge representations in their assigned texts, they performed better on various measures of learning (use of processing strategies, text recall, and changes in misconceptions) than when their epistemic beliefs were inconsistent with the knowledge representations. These results have implications for how researchers conceptualize epistemic beliefs and support contemporary views regarding the context sensitivity of individuals' epistemic beliefs.

  abstract = {1.Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behavior are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. 2.BORIS is a free, open-source and multi-platform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. 3.Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g., simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. 4.Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time budget for single or grouped observations automatically, and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioral features. The observation data and time budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL, JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS, PDF). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Subjects of the study were 76 sixth-grade students in 3 different mathematics classes in a central North Carolina middle school. The first two parts of the written instrument were administered as both a pretest and a posttest, using line plots and bar graphs; the second two parts, using stem plots and histograms, were administered only as a posttest, since few students have had experience with these graphs. For each question on the tests, the analysis involved categorizing responses in ways that characterized the nature of students' thinking. Results indicated that students: (1) confuse the axes of line plot and histogram type graphs; (2) have problems using intervals of data; (3) use the "middle" of the data to describe what is typical much less frequently than the mode; and (4) seem to find the measures of center, mean and median, not readily identifiable from the graph. Findings revealed that the manner in which questions were posed could influence the categorization of student responses, as could the visual features of the graphs, and that the students' interpretation of the word typical may not be viewed as intended. Further research is suggested to look at both visual and wording effects more systematically. (Includes 6 figures of data and 26 references.)},

The article contained a production-related error. The sixth equation under ``Effect Sizes Specific to Comparing Two Conditions'' should have had a plus sign rather than a minus sign in the denominator. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2001, American Psychological Association, 2010) calls for the reporting of effect sizes and their confidence intervals. Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial {$\eta$}2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.

Both the Bayesian Student's t-test and the Bayesian Welch's t-test are available in this software package. The sample size is determined such that the median Bayes factor exceeds a user defined cut-off value. Topics that will receive attention are: SSD for H0 versus an a priori point and an a priori distribution alternative; prior sensitivity; and, the use of Bayes factor as a measure of support and as a decision criterion. Using the R package SSDbain and/or the tables and figures provided in this paper, psychological researchers can easily determine the required sample size.},

Conventionally, reliability coefficients, such as Cronbach's alpha, are calculated using a Pearson correlation matrix. Ordinal reliability coefficients, such as ordinal alpha, use the polychoric correlation matrix (Zumbo, Gadermann, \& Zeisser, 2007). This paper presents (i) the theoretical-psychometric rationale for using an ordinal version of coefficient alpha for ordinal data; (ii) a summary of findings from a simulation study indicating that ordinal alpha more accurately estimates reliability than Cronbach's alpha when data come from items with few response options and/or show skewness; (iii) an empirical example from real data; and (iv) the procedure for calculating polychoric correlation matrices and ordinal alpha in the freely available software program R. We use ordinal alpha as a case study, but also provide the syntax for alternative reliability coefficients (such as beta or omega).},

This study examines the effects of student feedback. For this purpose, 305 teachers who are users of a web-based student feedback system that is available in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (Germany) were surveyed using a self-designed questionnaire. Using multiple regressions, self-reported changes in teaching can be predicted from existing levels of motivation and the constructiveness of the discussion between students and the classroom teacher. Externally motivated student feedback appears to lead to changes in the classroom as well. The results argue for the integration of student feedback into a school-wide quality management system. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Methodological criticisms bear upon plausibility, predetermined coding categories, ignoring of content, the role of cognitive mediation, the need for experiments, and quality of outcome measures. Criticisms of productivity concern the yield in understanding (theory), predictive power, and control (improvement) of teaching. Criticisms of interpretation-application relate to the use of meta-analysis and the conversion of findings into rules for teaching.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a scale to measure health-related graph literacy and investigate the level of graph literacy in the United States and Germany. DESIGN: Experimental and questionnaire studies. Setting. Computerized studies in the laboratory and on probabilistic national samples in the United States and Germany. Participants. Nationally representative samples of people 25 to 69 years of age in Germany (n = 495) and the United States (n = 492). Laboratory pretest on 60 younger and 60 older people. Measurements. Psychometric properties of the scale (i.e., reliability, validity, discriminability) and level of graph literacy in the two countries. RESULTS: The new graph literacy scale predicted which patients can benefit from visual aids and had promising measurement properties. Participants in both countries completed approximately 9 of 13 items correctly (in Germany, x\textasciimacron{} = 9.4, s = 2.6; in the United States, x\textasciimacron{} = 9.3, s = 2.9). Approximately one third of the population in both countries had both low graph literacy and low numeracy skills. Limitations. The authors focused on basic graph literacy only. They used a computerized scale; comparability with paper-and-pencil versions should be checked. CONCLUSIONS: The new graph literacy scale seems to be a suitable tool for assessing whether patients understand common graphical formats and shows that not everyone profits from standard visual displays. Research is needed on communication formats that can overcome the barriers of both low numeracy and graph literacy.},

I started the degree with questions about the 2008/09 financial crisis and planned to spend most of my time researching about capital adequacy requirements. But I quickly realized much of my time would actually be spent learning the day-to-day tasks of data gathering, analysis, and results presentation. After plodding through for awhile, the breaking point came while reentering results into a regression table after I had tweaked one of my statistical models, yet again. Surely there was a better way to do research that would allow me to spend more time answering my research questions. Making research reproducible for others also means making it better organized and efficient for yourself. So, my search for a better way led me straight to the tools for reproducible computational research. The reproducible research community is very active, knowledgeable and helpful. Nonetheless, I often encountered holes in this collective knowledge, or at least had no resource to bring it all together as a whole. That is my intention for this book: to bring together the skills I have picked up for actually doing and presenting computational research. Hopefully, the book along with making reproducible research more common, will save researchers hours of Googling, so they can spend more time addressing their research questions. I would not have been able to write this book without many people's advice and support. Foremost is John Kimmel, acquisitions editor at Chapman \{\&\} Hall.

We use an optimal scaling procedure, assigning scores to each of 271 distinct occupation categories in such a way as to maximize the role of occupation as an intervening variable between education and income (in contrast to taking prestige as the criterion for weighting education and income, as in the Duncan scale). We compare the resulting scale to two existing internationally standardized measures of occupational status, Treiman's international prestige scale (SIOPS) and Goldthorpe's class categories (EGP), and also with several locally developed SEI scales. The performance of the new ISEI scale compares favorably with these alternatives, both for the data sets used to construct the scale and for five additional data sets. \textcopyright{} 1992.},

Using confirmatory factor analysis, the alternative forms were compared on criteria of methods variance and construct validity. Neither method appeared to be empirically better than the other.

  abstract = {Widespread misperceptions undermine citizens' decision-making ability. Conclusions based on falsehoods and conspiracy theories are by definition flawed. This article demonstrates that individuals' epistemic beliefs-beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how one comes to know-have important implications for perception accuracy. The present study uses a series of large, nationally representative surveys of the U.S. population to produce valid and reliable measures of three aspects of epistemic beliefs: reliance on intuition for factual beliefs (Faith in Intuition for facts), importance of consistency between empirical evidence and beliefs (Need for evidence), and conviction that "facts" are politically constructed (Truth is political). Analyses confirm that these factors complement established predictors of misperception, substantively increasing our ability to explain both individuals' propensity to engage in conspiracist ideation, and their willingness to embrace falsehoods about high-profile scientific and political issues. Individuals who view reality as a political construct are significantly more likely to embrace falsehoods, whereas those who believe that their conclusions must hew to available evidence tend to hold more accurate beliefs. Confidence in the ability to intuitively recognize truth is a uniquely important predictor of conspiracist ideation. Results suggest that efforts to counter misperceptions may be helped by promoting epistemic beliefs emphasizing the importance of evidence, cautious use of feelings, and trust that rigorous assessment by knowledgeable specialists is an effective guard against political manipulation.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Garrett, Weeks.

Zun{\"a}chst werden beide Evaluationsans{\"a}tze skizziert, aktuelle Erkenntnisse {\"u}ber die Wirkung auf die Entwicklung von Schulqualit{\"a}t dargestellt sowie das Verh{\"a}ltnis zwischen normativen Setzungen und Bildungsforschung diskutiert. Beide Evaluationsans{\"a}tze richten ihr Augenmerk weniger auf schulische Outputs wie z. B. Sch{\"u}lerleistungen, sondern vielmehr auf schulische Prozesse wie Schulmanagement oder die Qualit{\"a}t des Unterrichts. Externe Evaluation in Form von Schulinspektion erf{\"u}llt vornehmlich die Funktion von Rechenschaftslegung und der Identifizierung schwacher Schulen. Zur Unterst{\"u}tzung der Schulentwicklung ist die interne Evaluation vermutlich besser geeignet. Um sie jedoch als systematischen Prozess der Qualit{\"a}tsentwicklung in Verantwortung der Einzelschule betreiben zu k{\"o}nnen, fehlt es aktuell an der n{\"o}tigen Kompetenz. {\"U}berlegungen zum zuk{\"u}nftigen Verh{\"a}ltnis von interner und externer Evaluation richten sich darauf, externe Evaluation als "Meta-Evaluation" zu betreiben. Bevor externe Evaluation jedoch in dieser Art auf Ergebnisse interner Evaluation aufbauen kann, ist ein breiter Kompetenzaufbau in den Schulen als auch ein anderes Rollenverst{\"a}ndnis der Inspektoren n{\"o}tig. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;The overview article deals with the interaction of internal and external evaluation within the current paradigm of school governance. The actual practice of both approaches and the current state of research about the effects on school development is described. Both evaluation approaches are less focused on aspects of school output such as student performance, and more on school processes such as school management or the quality of teaching. External evaluation in the form of school inspection mainly fulfills the function of accountability and the identification of weak schools. Internal evaluation is probably a better way to achieve school development. However, the necessary competence to use internal evaluation as a systematic process of quality management for which each individual school takes responsibility is currently underdeveloped. Considerations about the future relationship between internal and external evaluation focus on using external evaluation as a kind of "meta-evaluation". But before external evaluation can build on results of internal evaluation in this way, a broad capacity building in schools and a different understanding of the role of inspectors are necessary.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the analysis of collaborative learning. The approach posits that different dimensions of collaborative learning emerging from social ties and content analysis of discourse can be modeled as networks. As such, the combination of social network analysis (SNA) and epistemic network analysis (ENA) analysis can detect information about a learner's enactment of what the literature on collaborative learning has described as a role: an ensemble of cognitive and social dimensions that is marked by interacting with the appropriate people about appropriate content. The proposed approach is named social epistemic network signature (SENS) and is defined as a combination of these two complementary network analytic techniques. The proposed SENS approach is examined on data produced in collaborative activities performed in a massive open online course (MOOC) delivered via a major MOOC platform. The results of a study conducted on a data set collected in a MOOC suggest SNA and ENA produce complementary results which can i) explain collaboration processes that shaped the creation of social ties and that were associated with different network roles; ii) describe differences between low and high performing groups of learners; and iii) show how combined properties derived from SNA and ENA predict academic performance.},

Some scholars, however, have doubts about how accurately these kinds of questions measure the views of the public. A chief concern is that the questions tap, in part, people's ability to articulate a response, not their underlying attitudes. This paper tests whether this concern is warranted. Using open-ended questions from the Center for Political Studies, I show that almost all people respond to open-ended questions. The few individuals who do not respond appear uninterested in the specific question posed, not unable to answer such questions in general. These findings should increase our confidence in work of scholars who have relied on open-ended questions.},

Four aspects of instruction were distinguished: purposeful teaching, adaptive instruction, feedback and learning time. Data were collected by means of a survey (n~=~318) and through interviews with teachers (n~=~18). The results show that although almost all teachers use data with the intention of improving their instruction, they skip important steps in the data use process. They do not make optimal use of all available data and fail to carry out all the relevant analyses. Teachers mainly use data when their own students have disappointing learning outcomes. They are, however, less interested in using data related to the functioning of the school as a whole.},

  abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the \$p\$-values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Background: This research review provides an analysis of current research related to school and district data use, with a particular focus on identifying key characteristics of schools and districts with effective ``data using cultures.'' The research review identifies and analyzes findings in five key areas of practice: communicating professional expectations for data use; providing resources and assistance to make meaning from data; participating in the flow of information for data use; providing professional development on data use knowledge and skills; and providing leadership to nurture a culture of data use. Purpose: The goal of this literature review was to identify key elements that the research identi- fies as essential to developing a school or district culture of data use. Through the literature review and analysis, this article proposes a conceptual framework for school and district data use practices that can be used to guide professional learning in the area of data use. Research Design: The research design is an analytic essay. The article includes an analysis of current literature on school and district data use, compares key concepts presented in current studies and literature reviews, and offers conclusions based on these findings. Conclusions: This research review provides a conceptual framework of five elements that school and district leaders can use to guide professional learning in data use. The framework provides a ``mental map'' for addressing the range of knowledge and skills teachers must learn to use data as a routine part of their daily practice. In particular, the Culture of Data Use Framework is designed to help school and district leaders and professional development providers tease apart the specific areas of focus for training and support. The author outlines considerations for professional learning for each of the five framework elements and closes with a set of questions that may help to highlight future research needs in the area of school- level data use.},

  abstract = {Many doctors, patients, journalists, and politi- cians alike do not understand what health statistics mean or draw wrong conclusions without noticing. Collective statistical illiteracy refers to the widespread inability to understand the meaning of numbers. For instance, many citizens are unaware that higher survival rates with can- cer screening do not imply longer life, or that the statement that mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by25\%in fact means that 1 less woman out of 1,000 will die of the disease. We provide evidence that statistical illiteracy (a) is common to patients, jour- nalists, and physicians; (b) is created by nontransparent framing of information that is sometimes an unintentional result of lack of understanding but can also be a result of intentional efforts to manipulate or persuade people; and (c) can have serious consequences for health. The causes of statistical illiteracy should not be attrib- uted to cognitive biases alone, but to the emotional nature of the doctor\textendash{}patient relationship and conflicts of interest in the healthcare system. The classic doctor\textendash{}patient rela- tion is based on (the physician's) paternalism and (the patient's) trust in authority, whichmakestatistical literacy seem unnecessary; so does the traditional combination of determinism (physicians who seek causes, not chances) and the illusion of certainty (patients who seek certainty when there is none).We show that information pamphlets, Web sites, leaflets distributed to doctors by the pharma- ceutical industry, and even medical journals often report evidence in nontransparent forms that suggest big benefits of featured interventions and small harms. Without un- derstanding the numbers involved, the public is susceptible to political and commercial manipulation of their anxieties and hopes, which undermines the goals of informed con- sent and shared decision making. Address correspondence to Gerd Gigerenzer, Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition, Max Planck Institute for Human Develop- ment, Lentzeallee 94, 14195 Berlin; e-mail: gigerenzer@mpib-berlin. mpg.de. What can be done? We discuss the importance of teaching statistical thinking and transparent representa- tions in primary and secondary education as well as in medical school. Yet this requires familiarizing children early on with the concept of probability and teaching sta- tistical literacy as the art of solving real-world problems rather than applying formulas to toy problems about coins and dice. A major precondition for statistical literacy is transparent risk communication. We recommend using frequency statements instead of single-event probabilities, absolute risks instead of relative risks, mortality rates in- stead of survival rates, and natural frequencies instead of conditional probabilities. Psychological research on transparent visual and numerical forms of risk commu- nication, as well as training of physicians in their use, is called for. Statistical literacy is a necessary precondition for an educated citizenship in a technological democracy. Un- derstanding risks and asking critical questions can also shape the emotional climate in a society so that hopes and anxieties are no longer as easily manipulated from outside and citizens can develop a better-informed and more re- laxed attitude toward their health.},

Data graphs are used to present the means of different conditions and are supposed to convey group information, such as variability across conditions, as well as the grand average. Across three samples, we tested whether there is a bias in the central tendency perceived in bar graphs, 53 participants with a mean age of 27 years (plus replication with N = 38, mean age = 23 years). Participants were provided with bar and point graphs and had to judge their means. We found that the mean value was systematically underestimated in bar graphs (but not in point graphs) across different methods of testing for biased evaluation. In a second experiment (N = 80, mean age = 24 years) we replicated and extended this finding, by testing the effect of outliers on the bias in average estimation. For instance, outliers might trigger controlled processing. Yet, the underestimation of the average was replicated and was not affected by including outliers - despite that the estimate was torn towards the outlier. Thus, we should be cautious with relying on bar graphs when a bias free estimate of the grand average is relevant.},

The present volume aims to integrate existing methodological developments within a consistent terminology and notation, provide examples and explain a number of new developments, especially in the areas of discrete response data, time series models, random cross classifications, errors of measurement, missing data and nonlinear models. In many cases these developments are the subject of continuing research, so that we can expect further elaborations of the procedures described.The main text seeks to avoid undue statistical complexity, with methodological derivations occurring in appendices.

Bubble Treemaps do not require any color or shading, which offers additional design choices. We explore uncertainty visualization as an application of our treemaps using standard error and Monte Carlo-based statistical models. To this end, we discuss how uncertainty propagates within hierarchies. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of our visualization using three different examples: the package structure of Flare, the S\&P 500 index, and the US consumer expenditure survey.},

Results showed no changes in teacher knowledge of assessment concepts across the training. Teacher self-efficacy for assessment tasks, however, increased significantly. Teachers reported self-efficacy levels that were modestly correlated with their demonstrated knowledge. These results highlight an opportunity to investigate affective and contextual variables as outcomes or mediators of assessment literacy initiatives and examine existing assessment literacy measures for sensitivity to change. Future studies and professional development efforts should consider how to engage teachers in authentic training opportunities that stimulate transferable growth while remaining feasible within constraints of time and geography.},

  abstract = {Behavioral science researchers routinely use scale scores that sum or average a set of questionnaire items to address their substantive questions. A researcher applying multiple imputation to incomplete questionnaire data can either impute the incomplete items prior to computing scale scores or impute the scale scores directly from other scale scores. This study used a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact of imputation method on the bias and efficiency of scale-level parameter estimates, including scale score means, between-scale correlations, and regression coefficients. Although the choice of imputation approach had no influence on the bias of scale-level parameter estimates, it had a substantial impact on efficiency, such that item-level imputation consistently produced a meaningful power advantage. The simulation results clearly supported the use of item-level imputation. To illustrate the differences between item- and scale-level imputation, we examined predictors of 7th-grade academic self-efficacy in a sample of 595 low-income Mexican Origin adolescents in a planned missingness design. The results of the empirical data analysis were consistent with those of the simulation and also suggested that researchers should be cautious when implementing planned missing data designs that necessitate scale-level imputation.},

In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

The study weighed the relative contributions of demographic factors (i.e. gender, age, years of teaching experience), teacher satisfaction, and teacher-rated school climate that predict resultant levels of teacher stress and burnout from 17 rural schools in southeastern Ohio. Results revealed that different aspects of school climate related to each of the three primary burnout dimensions. Further, the inverse relationship between school climate and burnout was mediated by teacher satisfaction levels for both Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization dimensions. Results from the present study may be used in the development of future intervention targets for reducing teacher stress and burnout.

Qualitatively different positions, including realism, dogmatism, skepticism, and rationalism, are characterized according to individuals' beliefs across three dimensions in a model of epistemic and ontological cognition. This model incorporates ideas from philosophical epistemology, including a focus on students' multiple means of justification. Concerns regarding the psychometric qualities of quantitative measures of personal epistemology inform this model and its proposed operationalization. We suggest a means of statistical analysis that can be used to assess the construct and predictive validity of this conceptual model by testing the relations among positions, dimensions, and covariates of interest. Future research directions include investigating how individuals choose among various forms of justification.

Learner characteristics, such as epistemic beliefs, influence SRL processing. Therefore, research into learning with CBLEs must account for interactions between epistemic beliefs and SRL. In this article we integrate epistemic belief frameworks and models of SRL, and we argue that both phenomena should be modeled as a dynamic series of events. Such modeling allows for an examination of how various epistemic beliefs may be activated and deactivated through the process of self-regulation. We also show how CBLEs can be used to measure epistemic beliefs in novel ways and study how epistemic beliefs and SRL interact. Finally, we identify areas for future research and educational implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Unfortunately, the dominant means of measuring epistemic cognition, self-report instruments, have numerous psychometric problems. These problems prompted us to return to interview methods used by Perry and other seminal researchers, to investigate the degree to which current epistemic cognition models aligned with novices' and experts' cognition. Using an exploratory, multiple case qualitative design, we interviewed middle school students and university professors from two domains, biology and history. We found numerous ways in which the current conceptualizations and measures of beliefs about knowledge and knowing may need to be altered. Our recommendations range from the revision of item wordings to a complete rethinking of the very idea of domain-specificity in epistemic cognition research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 American Psychological Association. Epistemic cognition, defined as the ways that people acquire, justify, and use knowledge, has been a prominent area of scholarship in educational psychology for nearly 50 years. Researchers have argued that epistemic cognition is a key predictor of many 21st century learning outcomes including critical thinking, scientific literacy, and historical thinking, among others. Despite a large volume of quantitative empirical research on epistemic cognition and academic achievement, there has been no published systematic analysis of this literature. We conducted a meta-analysis of 132 nonexperimental studies in this literature, and found epistemic cognition, as measured predominantly in terms of beliefs, was positively correlated with academic achievement, r = .162, p {$<$} .001, indicating a small but meaningful relationship. Moderator analyses revealed models and instruments focusing on development and justification of knowledge had higher correlations with academic achievement than those focused on constructs related to authority. We found evidence supporting domain-general, domain-specific, and topic-specific conceptualizations of epistemic cognition, and stronger correlations when the specificity of the epistemic cognition measure matched the specificity of the achievement measure. Conceptual knowledge and argumentation performance were more strongly associated with epistemic cognition than declarative or procedural knowledge performance. Finally, we found epistemic cognition predicted academic achievement from elementary school through graduate school, suggesting the importance of studying epistemic cognition across all educational levels. These findings have direct implications for honing epistemic cognition theory, creating better measures of epistemic cognition, and developing effective educational interventions on this critical topic.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so\textemdash{}and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.]},

In stepwise multiple regression, social support at work and the coping responses behavioral disengagement and suppression of competing activities predicted job stress independently of age, gender, class size, occupational grade and negative affectivity. High job stress was associated with low social support at work and greater use of coping by disengagement and suppression of competing activities. It is suggested that behavioral disengagement and suppression of competing activities are maladaptive responses in a teaching environment and may actually contribute to job stress.

So far, there are no tools suitable for general-purpose real-time data analysis in school. In this paper, we discuss this topic from a secondary CS education perspective.

Thereby, students are enabled to conduct data analyses using, for example, sensor data or web APIs.

Questionnaires were collected from 166 teachers from six secondary schools in the greater London area.

Regression analyses show that of the Karasek components, job demands was the most consistent predictor for the study outcomes, whereas control and social support appeared to have less predictive power. The inclusion of other job aspects (e.g., physical exertion, environmental risks, and job meaningfulness) significantly added varying degrees to the explained variance of the outcomes. The addition of coping strategies marginally adds to overall explained variances of the burnout components. The UK teachers were considerably worse off than their European colleagues on all outcome measures, and the majority of the predictor variables. They appear to use different coping strategies, work under worse conditions and report lower levels of psychological and physical well-being.

Zur Unterst\dbend{}tzung der Schulentwicklung ist die interne Evaluation vermutlich besser geeignet.

Bevor externe Evaluation jedoch in dieser Art auf Ergebnisse interner Evaluation aufbauen kann, ist ein breiter Kompetenzaufbau in den Schulen als auch ein anderes Rollenverst\dbend{}ndnis der Inspektoren n\dbend{}tig. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;The overview article deals with the interaction of internal and external evaluation within the current paradigm of school governance. The actual practice of both approaches and the current state of research about the effects on school development is described. Both evaluation approaches are less focused on aspects of school output such as student performance, and more on school processes such as school management or the quality of teaching. External evaluation in the form of school inspection mainly fulfills the function of accountability and the identification of weak schools. Internal evaluation is probably a better way to achieve school development. However, the necessary competence to use internal evaluation as a systematic process of quality management for which each individual school takes responsibility is currently underdeveloped. Considerations about the future relationship between internal and external evaluation focus on using external evaluation as a kind of "meta-evaluation". But before external evaluation can build on results of internal evaluation in this way, a broad capacity building in schools and a different understanding of the role of inspectors are necessary.

In this article, we provide an introduction to MI of multilevel missing data using the R package pan, and we discuss its possibilities and limitations in accommodating typical questions in multilevel research. To make pan more accessible to applied researchers, we make use of the mitml package, which provides a user-friendly interface to the pan package and several tools for managing and analyzing multiply imputed data sets. We illustrate the use of pan and mitml with two empirical examples that represent common applications of multilevel models, and we discuss how these procedures may be used in conjunction with other software.},

The global hypothesis test of the ANOVA can be reformulated as a regression model in which all group differences are simultaneously tested against zero. Multiple imputation offers reliable and effective treatment of missing data; however, recommendations differ with regard to what procedures are suitable for pooling ANOVA results from multiply imputed datasets. In this article, we compared several procedures (known as D1, D2, and D3) using Monte Carlo simulations. Even though previous recommendations have advocated that D2 should be avoided in favor of D1 or D3, our results suggest that all procedures provide a suitable test of the ANOVA's global null hypothesis in many plausible research scenarios. In more extreme settings, D1 was most reliable, whereas D2 and D3 suffered from different limitations. We provide guidelines on how the different methods can be applied in one- and two-factorial ANOVA designs and information about the conditions under which some procedures may perform better than others. Computer code is supplied for each method to be used in freely available statistical software.},

Our attention to teachers' mathematical conceptions focused on the development of PMTs' problem-solving competences. Our attention to teachers' meta-mathematical and pedagogical conceptions focused on changes in teachers' views concerning the level of interest and level of difficulty of the mathematical tasks. We differentiated between the systematic and craft modes of professional development integrated in the course. Systematic mode involved problem-solving sessions and reflective discussions on collective solution spaces. Craft mode involved interviewing school students. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of MSTs for PMTs' professional development.},

  abstract = {Over the past three decades, research into the developmental course by means of which persons come to an increasingly mature conception of the knowing process has yielded an highly defracted picture. Despite some concert of opinion about the general bill of particulars, what remains deeply problematic is the increasingly radical disagreement that has arisen regarding the ages at which major milestones in the course of epistemic development are said to be reached. As a way of making some sense of these competing claims, it is argued that the emerging insight that knowledge is ineluctably shaped by those doing the knowing (i.e., that there is an unavoidable "world-to-mind direction of fit" (J.R. Searle, Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1983) between things in the world and the manner of their understanding) does not arrive in a single piece. Instead, as the data presented here help to illustrate, an appreciation of the constructed character of knowledge more commonly arrives piecemeal and at different ontogenetic moments, the times of which are governed by the place that different objects of knowledge occupy along an envisioned continuum of diverse epistemic contents. On this account, not all "facts of the matter" are ordinarily seen to occupy the same epistemic footing. Rather, some so-called facts are commonly understood to be of an "institutional" sort, where "representational" diversity is early expected and widely tolerated. By contrast, other objects of knowledge are imagined to be more like "brute" facts that, on some less mature readings, fully escape the clutches of subjective opinion. Viewed against the backcloth of this proposed continuum, a developmental sequence hypothesized according to which growing persons first come to view "institutional" facts as humanly constructed before subsequently coming to a similar view about presumptively "brute" facts. To test this hypothesis, 242 young persons were administered a paper and pencil measure of epistemic reasoning (the EDQ). Results strongly support the hypothesis that respondents understood the interpretive nature of beliefs about "institutional" facts at an earlier age than so-called "brute" facts. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {We tested whether mere source attribution is sufficient to cause polarization between groups, even on consensual non-divisive positions. Across four studies (N = 2182), using samples from Germany, the UK, and the USA, agreement with aphorisms was high in the absence of source attribution. In contrast, atheists agreed less with brief aphorisms when they were presented as Bible verses (Studies 1 and 2), whereas Christians agreed more (Study 2). Democrats and Republicans (USA) and Labour supporters and Conservative supporters (UK) agreed more with politically non-divisive aphorisms that were presented as originating from a politician belonging to their own party (e.g., Clinton, Trump, Corbyn) than with the same aphorisms when they were presented as originating from a politician belonging to the rival party (Studies 3 and 4). This source attribution effect was not moderated by education, amount of thinking about the aphorisms, identification with the ingroup, trust, dissonance, fear of reproach, or attitude strength. We conclude that source attribution fundamentally interferes with epistemic progress in debate because of the way in which attributions of statements to sources powerfully affects reasoning about their arguments.},

  abstract = {Transparent communication of research is key to foster understanding within and beyond the scientific community. An increased focus on reporting effect sizes in addition to p value\textendash{}based significance statements or Bayes Factors may improve scientific communication with the general public. Across three studies (N\,=\,652), we compared subjective informativeness ratings for five effect sizes, Bayes Factor, and commonly used significance statements. Results showed that Cohen's U3 was rated as most informative. For example, 440 participants (69\%) found U3 more informative than Cohen's d, while 95 (15\%) found d more informative than U3, with 99 participants (16\%) finding both effect sizes equally informative. This effect was not moderated by level of education. We therefore suggest that in general, Cohen's U3 is used when scientific findings are communicated. However, the choice of the effect size may vary depending on what a researcher wants to highlight (e.g. differences or similarities).},

To estimate the effects of such institutional differences in the face of country heterogeneity, we employ an international differences-in-differences approach. We identify tracking effects by comparing differences in outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. Six international student assessments provide eight pairs of achievement contrasts for between 18 and 26 cross-country comparisons. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.},

SQL is often the first declarative programming language learned by students, which requires a different analysis approach than that used to understand the procedural or objectoriented programming paradigms with which students are more familiar. While some tools exist to help assess the correctness of an SQL query or address syntax errors, few tools focus on query semantics. DBQA does so by illustrating the effects that clauses and conditions have on an SQL SELECT statement using a visualized, data-oriented approach. We expect DBQA's approach to query evaluation to feel more familiar to those with experience in procedural or object-oriented programming and to help those users better understand the semantics of complex queries. DBQA includes support for SQL queries containing JOINs and subqueries, which have been shown to be among the most difficult for students to construct.},

In cases in which the data is incomplete, most researchers and common statistical software will use complete case analysis in order to estimate the R2, a procedure that might lead to biased results. In this paper, I introduce the use of multiple imputation for the estimation of R2 and adjusted R2 in incomplete data sets. I illustrate my methodology using a biomedical example.},

They worked on mathematics tests, received feedback on their test results and completed surveys measuring feedback's perceived usefulness, interest and self-evaluation. Results of path analysis showed that process-oriented feedback was perceived as more useful than grade-oriented feedback and that feedback's perceived usefulness had a positive effect on changes in achievement and interest. Consistent with this, process-oriented feedback had a greater positive indirect effect than grade-oriented feedback on changes in mathematics achievement and interest via its perceived usefulness. There were no such effects on changes in self-evaluation. Potential explanations for these findings, educational implications and possible directions for future research are discussed.

An understanding of the way that information can be conveyed via gesture and vocalization is present in infancy. Thus, infants seek information from well-informed interlocutors, supply information to the ignorant, and make sense of communicative acts that they observe from a third-party perspective. This basic understanding is refined in the course of development. As they age, children's reasoning about testimony increasingly reflects an ability not just to detect imperfect or inaccurate claims but also to assess what inferences may or may not be drawn about informants given their particular situation. Children also attend to the broader characteristics of particular informants\textemdash{}their group membership, personality characteristics, and agreement or disagreement with other potential informants. When presented with unexpected or counterintuitive testimony, children are prone to set aside their own prior convictions, but they may sometimes defer to informants for inherently social reasons.},

  abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.

As opposed to the Rasch model, assumptions on dimensionality of items, their mutual dependencies and the distribution of the latent trait in the population of subjects are relaxed. Conditional maximum likelihood estimation allows for inference about treatment, covariate or trend effect parameters without taking the subjects' latent trait values into account. In this paper we will show how LLRAs based on the LLTM, LRSM and LPCM can be used to answer various questions about the measurement of change and how they can be fitted in R using the eRm package. A number of small didactic examples is provided that can easily be used as templates for real data sets.},

Given the earlier quantitative result that no significant difference in performance between WeBWorK and PPH classes was found, a qualitative analysis of 358 student and instructor surveys revealed 3 primary categories of student perceptions related to WeBWorK: views about its usefulness, intentionality in engaging with mathematics, and challenges to student beliefs about mathematics. Student and instructor comments are reported within the context of self-regulated learning. Results support the conjecture that even a narrow use of WeBWorK, as a substitute for handwritten homework, is at least as effective as traditionally graded paper and pencil homework for students learning college algebra.

Methods: Participants were randomized to receive numerical information about the risks and benefits of a hypothetical medical treatment in one of six graph formats. Each described the benefits of taking one of two drugs, as well as the risks of experiencing side effects. Main outcome variables were verbatim (specific numerical) and gist (general impression) knowledge. Participants were also asked to rate their perceptions of the graphical format and to choose a treatment. Results: 2412 participants completed the survey. Viewing a pictograph was associated with adequate levels of both types of knowledge, especially for lower numeracy individuals. Viewing tables was associated with a higher likelihood of having adequate verbatim knowledge vs. other formats (p {$<$} 0.001) but lower likelihood of having adequate gist knowledge (p {$<$} 0.05). All formats were positively received, but pictograph was trusted by both high and low numeracy respondents. Verbatim and gist knowledge were significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) associated with making a medically superior treatment choice. Conclusion: Pictographs are the best format for communicating probabilistic information to patients in shared decision making environments, particularly among lower numeracy individuals. Practice Implications: Providers can consider using pictographs to communicate risk and benefit information to patients of different numeracy levels.},

  abstract = {When risky technologies are debated in the media or when cases of scientific misconduct are made public, inevitable discussions arise about public loss of trust in science. However, trust in science reaches far beyond such incidents: trust is of much more fundamental importance for science. Clearly, trust is pivotal in doing science, since researchers in their everyday practice rely on the knowledge produced by other experts with different specialization and expertise. In the same way, trust is fundamental for the public understanding of science. Laypeople depend on the knowledge of scientific experts when developing a personal stance on science-based issues and arriving at decisions about them. Laypeople only possess a bounded understanding of science, but nowadays they are able to rapidly access all kinds of scientific knowledge online. To deal with scientific information, laypeople have to trust in scientists and their findings. We will at first describe the role of trust in doing and understanding science. Then a summary of international survey results on the general public's trust in science are presented. Starting from these results and questions that arise from them, we extend and revise past conceptualizations of trust, arriving at a conceptualization of epistemic trust. Epistemic trust rests not only on the assumption that one is dependent on the knowledge of others who are more knowledgeable; it also entails a vigilance toward the risk to be misinformed. Drawing on empirical findings, we argue that the critical characteristics that determine the epistemic trustworthiness of a source of science-based information (for example, a scientist or a scientific institution) are the source's expertise, integrity and benevolence. These characteristics have already been described in the model of trust provided by Mayer et al. (1995), but when it comes to trust in context of science, they must be redefined. Furthermore, trust judgments are not based solely on these characteristics, but depend on further constrains, which will be discussed in this chapter.},

They also investigated whether it made a difference in who had brought forward the ethics aspects: the responsible scientist blogger or another expert. Results indicate that by the mere introduction of ethics, people infer something about the blogger's communicative intentions: Introducing ethical aspects seems to raise vigilance about an expert's benevolence and integrity. Moreover, ratings of epistemic trustworthiness differed depending on who added ethical arguments: If ethics were introduced by the scientist blogger himself, his benevolence and integrity were rated higher than when ethics were introduced by another expert. These results are relevant for science bloggers, science communicators, and researchers who study laypeople's understanding of epistemic uncertainty within science.},

In this preregistered experiment (N\,=\,484), we varied (a) whether a replication attempt was successful or not and (b) whether the replication was authored by the same, or another lab. Results showed that ratings of study credibility (e.g. evidence strength, {$\eta$}P2\,=\,.15) and researcher trustworthiness (e.g. expertise, {$\eta$}P2\,=\,.15) were rated higher upon learning of replication success, and lower in case of replication failure. The replication's author did not make a meaningful difference. Prior beliefs acted as covariate for ratings of credibility, but not trustworthiness, while epistemic beliefs regarding the certainty of knowledge were a covariate to both. Hence, laypeople seem to notice that successfully replicated results entail higher epistemic significance, while possibly not taking into account that replications should be conducted by other labs.},

Data included transcripts from nine videotaped class sessions from a US seventh-grade mathematics classroom during a unit on surface area and volume. The findings showed differences in the types of discourse interactions among the three types of discussions. By understanding the relationship between the instructional design and the discourse interactions associated with each discussion type, mathematics teachers may find opportunities to plan classroom discussions with higher quality interactions. In addition, teacher educators and mentor teachers can use the findings from this study to provide explicit assistance and feedback to prospective and newly inducted teachers who want to incorporate classroom discussion into their instructional units. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In order to fully exploit the potential of example-based learning, teachers should, however, know how to effectively employ such examples in classroom instruction. Therefore, we have designed a computer-based learning environment in which mathematics and science teachers learn how to effectively employ worked-out examples. The learning environment was developed according to approved design criteria. The topics that are addressed in the learning environment were chosen in response to the results of a needs assessment that analysed schoolbooks and classroom videos, and took interviews with teachers into account. In experiments as well as in several teacher trainings on example-based learning, the computer-based learning environment was evaluated and improved accordingly. On a more general level, our research and development project showed that a computer-based learning programme could be a sensible tool that supports follow-up work in teacher training contexts.},

Participants also reported their childhood and adult SES. Results revealed that people with higher childhood SES regulated food intake based on immediate energy need; they ate more when need was high than when need was low. This relationship was not observed among those with lower childhood SES. These individuals consumed comparably high amounts of food whether current energy need was high or low. Childhood SES may have a lasting impact on food regulation.},

Whether, for whom and which kind of job related treatment can be helpful for teachers returning to work can only be discussed if the specific stress and the social situation of teachers as public officials are taken into consideration. This article examines a systematic evaluation of 63 teachers (mean age 50 yrs) with psychosomatic disorders consecutively admitted in a psychosomatic hospital. Most suffered from depression or/and tinnitus. Most Ss rated job related stress as influencing their symptomatologies. A program focusing on discrepancies between personal ideals versus real situations in school, problems in social interactions and time management, should prove a valuable part of the teachers' psychosomatic inpatient treatment.

This study investigates the dimensionality of personal epistemology as hypothesized in a recent review of the literature as well as the nature of disciplinary differences. First-year college students responded to a set of questionnaires that included an adaptation of a domain-general epistemological instrument and a discipline-focused questionnaire. Results suggest that there is an underlying dimensionality to epistemological theories that cuts across disciplinary domains, but that students, at least by the 1st year of college, discriminate as to how these theories differ by discipline. Disciplinary differences were strong, suggesting that 1st-year college students see knowledge in science as more certain and unchanging than in psychology, are more likely to regard personal knowledge and firsthand experience as a basis for justification of knowing in psychology than in science, view authority and expertise as the source of knowledge more in science than in psychology, and perceive that in science, more than in psychology, truth is attainable by experts. This contradicts existing research that suggests that epistemological development is domain general and that epistemological beliefs do not differ by discipline. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

Classroom observations and interviews of 25 first-year students provide a contextualized perspective on the dimensionality of beliefs as identified in the literature: certainty of knowledge, simplicity of knowledge, source of knowledge, and justification for knowing. This research suggests that students' perceptions of instructional practices are interpreted through the lens of their epistemological assumptions, but that such perspectives are evolving and instructors may influence them in multiple ways. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The approach that is elaborated here is to conceive of epistemological understanding as a metacognitive process that activates epistemic theories, a multidimensional set of interrelated beliefs about knowledge and knowing. Building on the work of Flavell (1979), K. S. Kitchener (1983), and Kuhn (1999b), this article describes the rationale for conceptualizing epistemological awareness at the metacognitive level, delineates the nature of this construct, and describes how this directs methodological choices for research. This is discussed in light of a recent study of students' online searching for a simulated science assignment, investigated through the use of think-aloud protocols. Exploring students' thought processes during online searching allows examination of personal epistemology not as a decontextualized set of beliefs, but as an activated, situated aspect of cognition that influences the knowledge construction process.

Der Beitrag untersucht die mit diesem zweifachen Anspruch verbundenen Annahmen und Probleme und zeigt auf, dass im Wissens- und Erkenntnisbegriff eine konzeptionelle Schwachstelle der aktuellen Konzepte des Forschenden Lernens liegt, die eine begriffliche Differenzierung des Wissenskonstrukts erfordert.

Ss may perform summation operations to establish the whole with bar graphs, which would be unnecessary for other graph types depicting the whole with a single object. To test this summation model, the number of components forming the whole was varied with bars, divided bars, reference bars, and pies in 3 experiments using a total of 72 Ss. Response time increased with the number of components for bar graphs but there was little increase for other graph types in Exp 1. An accuracy emphasis in Exp 2 produced generally longer response times, but had little effect on the time per summation. The summation operation was not used when graphs were displayed briefly in Exp 3, although subjects still took longer with bars. The estimated time for a summation operation is consistent with estimates derived from other research. In general, the bar graph is not effective for proportion judgments, and its disadvantage becomes potentially greater as the number of components increases.},

Researchers interviewed and observed 14 elementary and secondary preservice teachers as they entered the teacher education program, attended reading classes at the university, then taught reading in school classrooms. These qualitative data were analyzed to determine (a) the patterns of intellectual change from novice preservice teacher to beginning classroom teacher; (b) the personal, program, and contextual influences or constraints on that change; (c) the role of the cooperating teacher and university supervisor in supporting intellectual change; and (d) the nature of prior beliefs on identity maintenance while learning. Findings include the importance of understanding preservice teachers' prior beliefs to inform supervision and university course design, the value of cognitive dissonance in practice teaching contexts, the need to routinize classroom management knowledge before attending to subject-specific pedagogy, and the importance of the academic task as part of the teaching knowledge base.},

Personal epistemology has been seen as promising particularly because it focuses on one of the general learning aims of many contemporary universities, namely, the development of students' creative and critical thinking. The article identifies serious conceptual problems in the theoretical framework of personal epistemology. First, we argue \textendash{} contrary to many promoters of personal epistemology \textendash{} that personal epistemology's theoretical models are not based merely on empirical data from developmental psychology, but clearly feature normative philosophical elements. Second, we consider the acceptance of relativism in the theoretical framework of personal epistemology. We argue that the concept of fallibilism has been overlooked, which has forced personal epistemology theorists to choose between na{\"i}ve realism and relativism. Their choice of relativism has led \textendash{} in addition to other philosophical problems \textendash{} to a loss of adequate definitions for the epistemological notions of objectivity and certainty. The recognition of epistemological fallibilism would be beneficial both to personal epistemology's theoretical framework and to personal epistemology\textendash{}based university pedagogy.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) Over the last several decades, psychologists have grown increasingly interested in understanding how individuals think about the nature of knowledge and themselves as knowers. Research in this area has primarily focused upon the relationship between personal epistemologies and how individuals learn in settings of formal education. Against this backdrop, different epistemological perspectives have been presented as part of a hierarchical, developmental sequence anchored by dualistic, objective epistemologies at one end, and contextual, constructed ways of knowing at the opposite end. Embedded in such a trajectory is the implicit (and often explicit) assumption that not all epistemological beliefs are created equally; some are viewed as cognitively complex and superior, while others are positioned as primitive and less than ideal. Such a view discounts how different ways of knowing may be adaptive and functional across different ecological contexts. Similarly, it ignores the possibility that many individuals have objectives that differ from those promoted and rewarded by institutions of higher education. With this in mind, the purpose of this chapter is to address the biases and limitations inherent in current models of epistemological development. Using several theoretical models that explain the dynamic interweaving of psychological and social processes, epistemic perspectives will be examined as systems of meaning-making that reflect the values, goals, and practices of diverse social groups.

Each of 27 high-profile social science findings was evaluated by 233 people without a PhD in psychology. Results showed that these laypeople predicted replication success with above-chance performance (i.e., 58\%). In addition, when laypeople were informed about the strength of evidence from the original studies, this boosted their prediction performance to 67\%. We discuss the prediction patterns and apply signal detection theory to disentangle detection ability from response bias. Our study suggests that laypeople's predictions contain useful information for assessing the probability that a given finding will replicate successfully.},

The first useful estimation method was the pseudobalanced method. This method is approximate because it assumes that all groups have the same size, and ignores unbalance when it exists. In addition, full infor-mation maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is now available, which is often combined with robust chi-squares and standard errors to accommodate unmodeled heterogeneity (MLR). In addition, diago-nally weighted least squares (DWLS) methods have become available as estimation methods. This article compares the pseudobalanced estimation method, ML(R), and two DWLS methods by simulating a multilevel factor model with unbalanced data.The simulations included different sample sizes at the individual and group levels and differ-ent intraclass correlation (ICC). The within-group part of the model posed no problems. In the between part of the model, the different ICC sizes had no effect. There is a clear interaction effect between number of groups and estimation method. ML reaches unbiasedness fastest, then the two DWLS methods, then MLR, and then the pseudo-balanced method (which needs more than 200 groups). We conclude that both ML(R) and DWLS are genuine improvements on the pseudo-balanced approximation. With small sample sizes, the robust methods are not recommended.},

  abstract = {\{\textbackslash{}dq\}This practical introduction helps readers apply multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an accessible introduction, the book also includes advanced extensions, making it useful as both an introduction and as a reference to students, researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an emphasis on understanding the methodological and statistical issues involved in using these models. The estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is demonstrated using realistic examples from various disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses, street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel regression model and multilevel structural models.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}Highlights of the second edition include:\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}--Two new chapters one on multilevel models for ordinal and count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival analysis (Ch. 8).\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-Thoroughly updated chapters on multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect the enormous technical progress of the last few years.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-The addition of some simpler examples to help the novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine more than one problem have been retained.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-A new section on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11).\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-Expanded discussions of covariance structures across time and analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous data and proportions with new estimation methods.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}-An updated website at v ww.000hox.net/ with data sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} \{\textbackslash{}dq\}Ideal for introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a variety of disciplines including: psychology, education, sociology, the health sciences, and business, the advanced extensions also make this a favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in these disciplines.

Bias distorts observed effect sizes beyond the expected level of attenuation due to intrarater error, and the impact of bias is not accurately estimated using conventional methods of correction for attenuation. Using a model based on multivariate generalizability theory, this article illustrates how bias affects research results. The model identifies 4 types of bias that may affect findings in research using observer ratings, including the biases traditionally termed leniency and halo errors. The impact of bias depends on which of 4 classes of rating design is used, and formulas are derived for correcting observed effect sizes for attenuation (due to bias variance) and inflation (due to bias covariance) in each of these classes. The rater bias model suggests procedures for researchers seeking to minimize adverse impact of bias on study findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supple- menting it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, Mc- Donald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff crite- ria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small},

Unfortunately, large percentages of teachers who suffer burnout remain in their positions (Jackson et al., 1986; Watts and Short, 1990) and may negatively affect the educational process. If the potential negative effects of burnout are to be avoided, it is necessary to identify behaviours that may serve as precursors to burnout. A model is presented here that incorporates a direct comparison between an employee's capacity and job demands (Jaques, 1961). The behaviours resulting from these comparisons are unique and may serve as precursors to the more intense attitudinal and behavioural outcomes associated with burnout (Cherniss, 1980a, 1980b; Maslach and Jackson, 1981, 1986). In addition, each unique behaviour (Jaques, 1961) represents an opportunity to manage turnover better and to intervene in the burnout process.

We found that educators made sense of some facets of the policies as complementary and others as contradictory. NCLB and IDEA offered consistent and specific guidelines defining ``highly qualified'' teachers and educators reported a clear and accurate understanding of these policy demands. On an issue where there was no specific guidance from NCLB\textendash{}the placement of special education students\textendash{}educators interpreted the law as promoting the inclusion of more students in general education courses, often to an extent that contradicted the guidance offered by IDEA. With respect to fundamental issues of teaching and learning, NCLB and IDEA represent contradictory theories of action and educators perceived conflict and expressed concerns about unintended consequences for students. Based on our empirical findings, we conclude with a set of theoretical propositions regarding how the alignment of policy messages influences educators' interpretation of policies, which in turn may have implications for how they enact policies.},

  abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption.

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

Replication studies were rare (n = 4), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014 (94.4\% in 2000 to 34.6\% in 2014); the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts (0\% in 2000, 15.4\% in 2014) or no conflicts (5.6\% in 2000, 50.0\% in 2014) increased. Articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category versus other fields were almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have private funding.

Semi-structured interviews, observations and reflective journals were used to document the changes experienced by participants as they went through their two placements during their one-year teacher education course. The data indicated that when the mentoring relationships were positive and expectations were met, preservice teachers felt more confident as a teacher. However, for some participants, who experienced a partially negative mentoring relationship, their confidence declined and they felt they did not improve. Implications for practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine how science teachers' epistemological beliefs impacted their use of authentic inquiry in science instruction. Participants in this multiple-case study included a total of four teachers who represented the middle, secondary and post-secondary levels. Based on the results of the pilot study conducted with a secondary science teacher, adjustments were made to the interview questions and observation protocol. Data collection for the study included semi-structured interviews, direct observations of instructional techniques, and the collection of artifacts. The cross case analysis revealed that the cases epistemological beliefs were mostly Transitional and the method of instruction used most was Discussion. Two of the cases exhibited consistent beliefs and instructional practices, whereas the other two exhibited beliefs beyond their instruction. The findings of this study support the literature on the influence of contextual factors and professional development on teacher beliefs and practice. The findings support and contradict literature relevant to the consistency of teacher beliefs with instruction. This study's findings revealed that the use of reform-based instruction, or Authentic Inquiry, does not occur when science teachers do not have the beliefs and experiences necessary to implement this form of instruction.

  abstract = {Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of ``Big Data'' problems, statistical learning has be- come a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this area\textemdash{}The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)\textemdash{}was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statis- tics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL's popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with ad- vanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less tech- nical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illus- trating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master's stu- dents in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data. It can be used as a textbook for a course spanning one or two semesters. We would like to thank several readers for valuable comments on prelim- inary drafts of this book: Pallavi Basu, Alexandra Chouldechova, Patrick Danaher, Will Fithian, Luella Fu, Sam Gross, Max Grazier G'Sell, Court- ney Paulson, Xinghao Qiao, Elisa Sheng, Noah Simon, Kean Ming Tan, and Xin Lu Tan.},

Confirming previous research, the results suggest that epistemological beliefs can be represented in terms of five factors: (a) certainty of knowledge, (b) omniscient authority, (c) orderly process, (d) innate ability, and (e) quick learning. Students who study in the "soft" fields (i.e., social science and arts/ humanities) have a stronger tendency to believe that knowledge is uncertain, are more reliant on their independent reasoning ability, and have a stronger feeling that learning is not an orderly process than students in "hard" fields (i.e., engineering and business). Graduate students showed a stronger tendency than undergraduate students to believe that knowledge is often uncertain, that learning is not usually an orderly process, and that knowledge is best acquired from independent reasoning. The results of this study suggest that students' beliefs about learning are a product of the activity, the culture, and the context in which they are cultivated.},

  issn = {14679620},
  abstract = {Background: In the last few decades, a focus on school accountability at the state and federal levels has created expectations for teachers to attend to data in increasingly structured ways. Although professional learning is often cited as an important facilitator of effective data use, research that focuses on the intersection of professional learning and data use is scarce. Examining teacher perceptions of data use supports, and contrasting assertions of what is desired in data-related professional learning with accounts of the ways in which this professional learning actually happens provide an avenue for exploring these issues and for building a research base that can inform the work of district and campus leaders as well as support providers. Focus of Study: This study aimed at examining teacher needs specific to data-related professional learning through a lens informed by knowledge-based organizational learning. We were guided by two broad questions: (a) What knowledge and skills do teachers need in order to engage in data-informed practice? (b) How do professional learning supports address these needs? Research Design: The qualitative study draws on document analysis as well as interview and focus group data collected from n=110 participants (teachers, school leaders, and district support staff) in three school districts in central Texas. Flexible a priori coding rooted in our conceptual framework was employed to examine data for themes common across district settings and across school levels (e.g., elementary, middle, high). Code counts were used to further examine areas of professional learning focus and/or apparent imbalance. Findings: Educators articulated professional learning needs related to data use in six main areas: (a) asking appropriate questions of data (to guide analysis and use); (b) accessing and operating district data systems; (c) data literacy/interpretation; (d) fitting data use with day-do-day practice; (e) sharing information via collaboration; and (f) knowledge codification. Of these, data capture via computer data systems was by far the most prominent focus reported by educators in each district. Clear plans for addressing data use capacity through professional learning supports were lacking. Recommendations: Taking into account teacher perspectives on what professional learning for data use was needed and on how such supports were, in reality, structured, we make three recommendations: (a) purposefully embed professional learning for data use in ongoing organizational routines; (b) mitigate the district level silos that separate training-on-computersystems from professional learning focused on turning data into action at the classroom level; and (c) seek balance in supporting the constellation of knowledge and skills that contribute to data use capacity.},

As a result, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the method of propensity score analysis be employed to overcome this problem. In this note, a formula for sample size calculation is developed based on a proposed weighted Mantel-Haenszel test on the strata defined by the propensity score analysis.

Epistemic beliefs were assessed with the Internet-Specific Epistemological Questionnaire (ISEQ) and processing of source information was measured through eye tracking, log files, and verbal protocols. Furthermore, Web users' post-search decisions and their basis for those decisions were assessed. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that beliefs in the Web as a reliable resource of accurate knowledge and detailed facts were related to decreased verbal reflection on the credibility and type of sources and decreased attention to the URLs of the search results, as well as a greater certainty in the post-search decision. In addition, doubts about the need to check knowledge claims on the Web against other sources, reason, and prior knowledge were related to a more one-sided representation of the conflicting issue. In conclusion, the findings suggested that Internet-specific certainty, source, and structure beliefs primarily play a role in source evaluation, while Internet-specific beliefs about the justification for knowing primarily play a role in constructing a complete representation of document contents. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to content information from the websites that should be filled into the worksheet, the worksheet provided source prompts to fill in website names and to classify the websites according to given source categories. To test the effectiveness of these source prompts, half of the students received a worksheet without such prompts. The study results indicate that students who had been working with the worksheet providing source prompts outperformed controls in their memory for sources, their discrimination between credible and less credible sources, and their mental representations of source-to-content links.

Validity is associated with the interpretation assigned to test scores rather than with the test scores or the test.

An explicit recognition of the inferences and assumptions in the interpretive argument makes it possible to identify the kinds of evidence needed to evaluate the argument.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand what personal epistemologies and science teaching goals preservice secondary science teachers of a teacher education program in the USA bring with them to their learning to teach and how they translate such beliefs into actions. A set of essay questions, developed through a pilot study, was used to identify preservice teachers' personal epistemologies and teaching goals at the beginning of science methods instruction. Classroom observation reports, video recorded teaching episodes, lesson plans and self-video reflections were collected to identify connections between their epistemologies, teaching goals, and practice of teaching. Relational and ontological dimensions of epistemological beliefs were found to be useful for understanding preservice teachers' personal epistemologies and teaching practices. The data suggests that the participants' espoused teaching goals were relevant to their personal epistemologies when differentiating na??ve personal epistemologies from the sophisticated, and their emerging teaching practices demonstrated shifts in personal epistemologies and potential for further development in teaching practices. Findings indicate sources of how teaching practices are shaped. Implications for teacher education include needs for addressing ways to deal with teaching constraints for constructivist teaching approaches, collaboration with content course instructors, critical reflection on field experience, and developing induction programs that support continuing development of emerging teaching practices.},

Such data often arise naturally from organizational structures in which within-group units (employees, students, etc.) are observed in larger between-group units (firms, schools, etc.) The article begins with an overview of the basic ideas of SEM and multilevel linear regression. The synthesis of both methods developed by Muth{\'e}in (1994) is then presented in the simple case of a multilevel path analysis model, in which the variations in within-group level intercepts are modeled as a function of between-group variables following their own path model. An application motivated by a real problem in the field of education that focuses on validating indicators of the quality of science education in the United States follows. The results show that it is possible to statistically capture the salient complexities of organizations through the application of multilevel SEM. The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of multilevel SEM for organizational studies.},

Our aim here is not to review the theories. Extensive reviews of motivational theories, their assumptions, and their applications to educational practice can be found in other excellent sources. Rather, for the purpose of this chapter, we highlight how assumptions that underlie contemporary motivational perspectives guide both theoretical explanations of motivational phenomena and the approach to and principles for applying these theoretical understandings to practice. We follow this discussion by pointing to epistemological assumptions about motivation and educational research shared by several of the currently dominant motivational theories and by listing theoretical, methodological, practical, and ethical challenges to these assumptions that can undermine the application of these motivational theories in educational settings. Finally, we end by suggesting possible directions for addressing these challenges and for developing general principles for conceptualizing, investigating, and applying motivational theory in educational practice.

Trials were included if direct costs {$>\$$}500,000/year, participants were adult humans, and the primary outcome was cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials meeting these criteria were coded for whether they were published prior to or after the year 2000, whether they registered in clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used active or placebo comparator, and whether or not the trial had industry co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported a positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome variable and for total mortality.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: 17 of 30 studies (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000 ({$\chi$}2=12.2,df= 1, p=0.0005). There has been no change in the proportion of trials that compared treatment to placebo versus active comparator. Industry co-sponsorship was unrelated to the probability of reporting a significant benefit. Pre-registration in clinical trials.gov was strongly associated with the trend toward null findings.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: The number NHLBI trials reporting positive results declined after the year 2000. Prospective declaration of outcomes in RCTs, and the adoption of transparent reporting standards, as required by clinicaltrials.gov, may have contributed to the trend toward null findings.},

Is there a relationship between the accuracy of elementary and secondary school teachers' judgments and the degree of cooperation among teachers, the degree of cooperation between teachers and parents and the variation of students' arithmetic, vocabulary, text comprehension and interest scores in mathematics and German? Data were obtained from a sample of 1984 4th-grade students and their 142 elementary school teachers and 914 5th-grade students (Gymnasium) and their 111 secondary school teachers. At each grade level, we used competence tests to measure students' vocabulary, text comprehension and arithmetic competence. Students also rated their own interest in mathematics and German. Elementary and secondary school teachers were asked to rate these traits for each of their students. As expected, elementary school teachers' diagnostic competence is higher in cognitive domains (arithmetic, vocabulary, text comprehension) and in non-cognitive domains (only for interest in German) than secondary school teachers' diagnostic competence. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the accuracy of school teachers' judgments on school achievement and the variation of students' arithmetic, vocabulary, text comprehension and interests scores in German.

One disadvantage of SQL is that it does not provide a universal quantification construct. Queries that have twisted universal and existential quantifiers can be stunning for students, practitioners, or even instructors. Universal quantification exists in natural languages and proliferates in our daily logic. Experience shows that students can infer the rigorous logic, such as the tuple relational calculus, from natural language queries, but find it cumbersome to translate it to SQL. To bridge this gap, this article develops a systematic method to translate tuple relational calculus queries to SQL. This is accomplished by introducing the SQL-Normal-From of tuple relational calculus from which generating SQL code is straightforward. The approach is illustrated by a series of examples. This method was voluntarily adopted by a vast majority of students when it was introduced in a third-year introductory course on database systems.

Design: Experts from a variety of disciplines defined clinically meaningful effects from their perspectives along with viewpoints about how to design and interpret randomized controlled trials. Setting: The article offers relevant, practical, and sometimes anecdotal information about clinically meaningful effects and how to interpret them. Participants: The concept for this session was the work of co-chairs Richard Keefe and the late Andy Leon. Faculty included Richard Keefe, PhD; James McNulty, AbScB; Robert S. Epstein, MD, MS; Shelby D. Reed, PhD; Juan Sanchez, MD; Ginger Haynes, PhD; Andrew C. Leon, PhD; Helena Chmura Kraemer, PhD; Ellen Frank, PhD, and Kenneth L. Davis, MD. Results: The term clinically meaningful effect is an important aspect of designing and interpreting randomized controlled trials but can be particularly difficult in the setting of psychopharmacology where effect size may be modest, particularly over the short term, because of a strong response to placebo. Payers, regulators, patients, and clinicians have different concerns about clinically meaningful effects and may describe these terms differently. The use of moderators in success rate differences may help better delineate clinically meaningful effects. Conclusion: There is no clear consensus on a single definition for clinically meaningful differences in randomized controlled trials, and investigators must be sensitive to specific concerns of stakeholders in psychopharmacology in order to design and execute appropriate clinical trials.},

Adults have a strong sense of how knowledge is clustered in the world around them and use that sense to access additional information, defer to relevant experts, and ground their own incomplete understandings. One prominent way of clustering knowledge is by disciplines similar to those that comprise the natural and social sciences. Seven studies explored an emerging sense of these discipline-based ways of clustering of knowledge. Even 5-year-olds could cluster knowledge in a manner roughly corresponding to the departments of natural and social sciences in a university, doing so without any explicit awareness of those academic disciplines. But this awareness is fragile early on and competes with other ways of clustering knowledge. Over the next few years, children come to see discipline-based clusters as having a privileged status, one that may be linked to increasingly sophisticated assumptions about essences for natural kinds. Possible mechanisms for this developmental shift are examined.},

Yet, recent views suggest that formal scientists may not be so different. In spite of these limitations, science somehow works and its success offers hope for the feasibility of folk science as well. The success of science arises from the ways in which scientists learn to leverage understandings in other minds and to outsource explanatory work through sophisticated methods of deference and simplification of complex systems. Three studies ask whether analogous processes might be present not only in lay people, but also in young children and thereby form a foundation for supplementing explanatory understandings almost from the start of our first attempts to make sense of the world},

Reviewers often sort programs according to design features such as program duration, intensity, or the use of specific techniques such as coaches or online lessons, but these categories do not illuminate the programs' underlying purpose or premises about teaching and teacher learning. This review sorts programs according to their underlying theories of action, which include (a) a main idea that teachers should learn and (b) a strategy for helping teachers enact that idea within their own ongoing systems of practice. Using rigorous research design standards, the review identifies 28 studies. Because studies differ in multiple ways, the review presents program effects graphically rather than statistically. Visual patterns suggest that many popular design features are not associated with program effectiveness. Furthermore, different main ideas are not differentially effective. However, the pedagogies used to facilitate enactment differ in their effectiveness. Finally, the review addresses the question of research design for studies of professional development and suggests that some widely favored research designs might adversely affect study outcomes.},

  abstract = {Context: Collaboration within school teams is considered to be important to build the capacity school teams need to work in a data-based way. In a school characterized by a strong collaborative culture, teachers may have more access to the knowledge and skills for analyzing data, teachers have more opportunity to discuss the performance goals to be set, and they also can share effective teaching strategies to achieve those goals. Although many studies on data-based decision making (DBDM) foreground the importance of teacher collaboration, our knowledge of what such collaboration looks like and how such collaboration may change during a DBDM reform remains limited. Objective: The current study uses a social network perspective to explore how collaboration in 32 elementary schools in the Netherlands takes shape in the interactions among teachers as they engage in a DBDM reform project. Research Design: Schools' social networks were examined at the start of the intervention and after having participated 1 year in the DBDM reform. Social networks regarding three DBDM topics are examined: (1) discussing student achievement; (2) discussing achievement goals; (3) and discussing instructional strategies. The density, reciprocity, and centralization of these networks were calculated, and multivariate multiple regression analysis was used to analyze changes over time. Conclusion: Findings suggest that teachers' DBDM related networks transform during the intervention, especially regarding the discussion of student achievement data: although the number of relationships remains stable, more reciprocal relationships are formed, and this network becomes less centralized around one or a few influential staff members.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that sophisticated epistemological beliefs exert a positive influence on students' learning strategies and learning outcomes. This gives a clear educational relevance to studies on the development of methods for promoting a change in epistemological beliefs and making them more sophisticated. AIMS: To investigate the potential for influencing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short instructional intervention. SAMPLE: On the basis of their performance on a preliminary survey of epistemological beliefs, 58 students at a German university (87.7\% females) with a mean age of 21.86 years (SD=2.88) were selected. Half of them had more naive beliefs and the other half had more sophisticated ones. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one whose epistemological beliefs were challenged through refutational epistemological instruction or another receiving non-challenging informational instruction. The treatment effect was assessed by comparing pre- and post-instructional scores on two instruments tapping different layers of epistemological beliefs (DEBQ and CAEB). Data were subjected to factor analyses and analyses of variance. RESULTS: According to the CAEB, the naive group receiving the refutational epistemological instruction changed towards a more sophisticated view, whereas the sophisticated students receiving the informational instruction changed towards an unintended, more naive standpoint. According to the DEBQ, all research groups except the naive refutational group revealed changes towards a more naive view. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the possibility of changing domain-specific epistemological beliefs through a short-term intervention. However, it questions the stability and elaborateness of domain-specific epistemological beliefs, particularly when domain knowledge is shallow.},

  author = {Kieser, Alfred and Leiner, Lars},
  abstract = {abstract In this paper we discuss, on the basis of system theory, the rigour\textendash{}relevance gap in management research and the proposal to overcome it. From a system theory perspective, social systems are self-referential or autopoietic, which means that communication elements of one system, such as science, cannot be authentically integrated into communication of other systems, such as the system of a business organization. Social systems can only irritate \textendash{} provoke \textendash{} each other, i.e. alter conditions in such a way that other systems are forced to respond. Because of the differences between management science and practice it is impossible to assess relevance of research output within the system of science. On the basis of our analysis we show that neither action research nor Mode 2 research nor recent approaches to collaborative research can succeed in producing research that is rigorous as well as relevant. Researchers and practitioners cannot collaboratively produce research, they can only irritate each other. However, sometimes irritations or provocations turn out inspiring. THE GAP In 1959, a Ford Foundation initiated report described American business education as an assembly of trade schools lacking a strong scientific foundation (Gordon and Howell, 1959). This report prompted efforts to infuse science into Western management educa-tion. Some 40 years later, management education may have done more than correct the deficit. It may have overcompensated. In a report from 1988, Porter and McKibbin (1988) complain that management education is narrow, overly-specialized, and does not provide students with the ability to relate to realistic management problem solving situations (Wren et al., 1994). Since then the rigour\textendash{}relevance gap has become a promi-nent issue for management science as well as for wider audiences. A look into the yearly presidential addresses at Academy of Management meetings reveals, for example, that in 1993,},

This simulation study with both continuous and categorical variables investigated the performance of MIMIC in detecting noninvariant variables under various study conditions and showed that the likelihood ratio test of MIMIC with Oort adjustment not only controlled Type I error rates below the nominal level but also maintained high power across study conditions.},

The results are discussed in view of contextual variables framing implementation of the teacher evaluation systems in these three districts. Also discussed are issues related to use of a single set of evaluation criteria, principals as evaluators, how to balance evaluation burdens with making reliable and valid decisions, human resource alignment and training in teacher evaluation systems. Sets of researchable propositions are formulated that address these issues and the findings are discussed in view of developing and implementing standards-based teacher evaluation systems.

This book fills a critical gap in our understanding of a long-neglected facet of the critical thinking process: reflective judgment. Drawing on extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal research, including their own ten-year study, Patricia M. King and Karen Strohm Kitchener detail the series of stages that lay the foundation for reflective thinking, and they trace the development of reflective judgment through adolescence and adulthood. King and Kitchener's new model of reflective judgment is designed to enhance both research and practice in the areas of critical thinking, intellectual development, and education. The authors examine key questions concerning reflective judgment: How do high school, college, and graduate students reason differently about ill-structured problems? Does students' reasoning improve with additional exposure to and involvement in higher education? Do adult learners differ from traditional-age students in their reflective thinking? How does the reasoning of adult college graduates differ from that of non-college-educated adults? The authors also describe the implications of the Reflective Judgment Model for working with students in the classroom and beyond - encouraging educators to think differently about interactions with their students and to create ways of more effectively promoting the ability to make reflective judgments.},

King, whose Reflective Judgment model encompasses both personal epistemology and skills of critical thinking (King and Kitchener, 1994). Kitchener also introduced the construct of epistemic cognition (Kitchener, 1983), a monitoring process that occurs in the solving of ill-structured problems. In this chapter, they explicate the relation between these constructs and review two decades of research on epistemic cognition and their seven-stage model of the development of reflective judgment. This model was empirically derived from individuals' responses to questions that elicit epistemological assumptions while reasoning about complex, open-ended problems. The authors explicate the roots of the concept of reflective judgment and how it is tied to epistemic cognition, provide a description of the model with illustrations from interviews with participants, and discuss the longitudinal and cross-sectional data on the model.

We employed a mixed- methods approach, combining data from a pre- and post-test data literacy test (N = 27), interviews (N = 12), evaluations of meetings (N = 33), and logbooks. Findings show that educators' data literacy increased significantly. Participants and the data coach indicated that educators had learned, for example, to analyze data with Excel, and to refute misconceptions. Still, there is room for further improvement. For example, educators struggled with formulating a data use purpose that is plausible, sufficiently concrete and measurable.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a seven-stage model of past-adolescent reasoning styles, the most advanced of which is called "Reflective Judgment." The model outlines a sequence of increasingly complex methods of justification of beliefs. This model demonstrates how people's conceptions of the nature of knowledge, the nature of reality, and their concepts of justification change over age/educational levels. Sixty subjects from three age/educational levels (high school, college, and graduate school) were administered the Reflective Judgment Interview. In addi- tion, subjects were tested on four other factors hypothesized to affect reflective judgment scores. Two were competing theoretical constructs: verbal ability (using Terman's Concept Mastery Test) and Piagetian formal operations (chemicals and pendulum tasks); and two were potentially confounding factors: socio-economic status (using Hollingshead's two-factor index) and verbal fluency (number of words spoken during the interview). Highly significant differences (p {$<$} .001) were found on reflective judgment level between the three age/educational groups, and could not be statistically accounted for by scores earned on mea- sures of the other four factors. Whereas verbal ability was found to be closely related to reflective judgment level, the differences between groups on reflective judgment could not be solely attributed to this factor.},

Three types of investigations are identified: examinations of observed relationships between social experiences and belief understanding, attempts to facilitate the reasoning of children on the verge of belief understanding through experiences intended to compel children to face reasoning inconsistencies; and training studies demonstrating that children can be trained to understand belief over time through specific feedback experiences. A comparison of these studies reveals that experience is defined differently across them, resulting in varying and sometimes ambiguous implications for a theory\textendash{}theory perspective on development. Implications for future research are discussed. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A meta-analysis (607 effect sizes; 23,663 observations) suggests that FIs improved performance on average ( d = .41) but that over one-third of the FIs decreased performance. This finding cannot be explained by sampling error, feedback sign, or existing theories. The authors proposed a preliminary FI theory (FIT) and tested it with moderator analyses. The central assumption of FIT is that FIs change the locus of attention among 3 general and hierarchically organized levels of control: task learning, task motivation, and meta-tasks (including self-related) processes. The results suggest that FI effectiveness decreases as attention moves up the hierarchy closer to the self and away from the task. These findings are further moderated by task characteristics that are still poorly understood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {The Occupational Stress and Coping Inventory (AVEM; Schaarschmidt \{\&\} Fischer, 1996, 1997) is a diagnostic instrument comprising 11 subscales designed to measure personal and social resources used to cope with occupational demands. Cluster analyses of teacher data identified four types (the healthy-ambitious type; the unambitious type; risk type A: the excessively-ambitious type; risk type B: the resigned type), who are assumed to differ in terms of both the occupational stress they experience and instructional behavior. Previous research seeking to validate this typology has drawn on teachers' self-report data. The present article examines the extent to which the stress experienced by mathematics teachers is reflected in students' reports of these teachers' instructional behavior. Data were obtained from a sample of 314 ninth-grade classes and their mathematics teachers in the context of the German national extension to the PISA 2003 study. The results indicate, first, that the Schaarschmidt \{\&\} Fischer typology can be replicated in the present sample. Second, on four of the six dimensions of instructional quality examined, significant differences were found between the four types, indicating that students perceive the instruction provided by teachers under stress to be of lower quality.

  abstract = {Teachers' occupational well-being (level of emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction) and quality of instruction are two key aspects of research on teaching that have rarely been studied together. The role of occupational engagement and resilience as two important work-related self-regulatory dimensions that predict occupational well-being and teachers' instructional performance in the classroom was investigated. In Part 1 of the study, self-regulatory data from 1,789 German mathematics teachers were subjected to a latent profile analysis, yielding four self-regulatory types (healthy-ambitious, unambitious, excessively ambitious, and resigned) that differed significantly on emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. In Part 2, the association between teachers' self-regulatory type and instructional performance was examined in a subsample of 318 teachers. Results showed that teachers' self-regulatory type predicted the quality of instruction in three of the four aspects of instructional performance examined. Moreover, teachers' self-regulatory type was systematically linked to differences in students' motivation. No association was found between teacher self-regulation and student achievement.

Individual-level data obtained from 1,939 secondary teachers as well as school-level data from their principals and students, based on 198 German schools, were subjected to multilevel analysis. School-level characteristics accounted for only a small amount of the variance in teachers' emotional exhaustion. In contrast, teachers' engagement differed considerably between schools. For the two outcome variables, engagement and exhaustion, specific patterns of predictive effects were observed at the school level: when controlling for individual teacher characteristics, the principal's support in educational matters predicted higher levels of engagement, whereas disciplinary problems in the classroom predicted higher emotional exhaustion. Although school-level data were associated with engagement and exhaustion, results suggest paying particular attention to individual differences between teachers that might predispose them to develop either more engagement or emotional exhaustion.

Auf Basis einer L{\"a}ngsschnitterhebung mit {\"u}ber 2000 Abiturienten in Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg (\guillemotleft{}Transformation des Sekundarschulsystems und Akademische Karrieren\guillemotright, TOSCA; K{\"o}ller, Watermann, Trautwein \& L{\"u}dtke, 2004) vergleicht die vorliegende Arbeit die kognitiven F{\"a}higkeiten, beruflichen Interessen und Pers{\"o}nlichkeitsmerkmale angehender Lehramtsstudierender mit den entsprechenden Merkmalen bei Studierenden anderer Fachrichtungen und untersucht dar{\"u}ber hinaus die relative Wichtigkeit dieser Merkmale bei der Studienwahl. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich die These einer generellen Negativ-Selektion in Bezug auf die kognitiven und psychosozialen Voraussetzungen von Lehramtsstudierenden empirisch nicht best{\"a}tigen l{\"a}sst.

The data are drawn from a small-scale longitudinal case study. They capture participants' preconceptions about theory before beginning training and subsequent developments through the course and into the first teaching post. The research finds these students to be far from na{\"i}ve at the outset, entering training open to a range of forms of learning, with a positive view of the potential contribution of theory to practice.

  abstract = {Background: Teaching is considered a highly stressful occupation. Burnout is a negative affective response occurring as a result of chronic work stress. While the early theories of burnout focused exclusively on work-related stressors, recent research adopts a more integrative approach where both environmental and individual factors are studied. Nevertheless, such studies are scarce with teacher samples. Aims: The present cross-sectional study sought to investigate the association between burnout, personality characteristics and job stressors in primary school teachers from Cyprus. The study also investigates the relative contribution of these variables on the three facets of burnout- emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. Sample: A representative sample of 447 primary school teachers participated in the study. Method: Teachers completed measures of burnout, personality and job stressors along with demographic and professional data. Surveys were delivered by courier to schools, and were distributed at faculty meetings. Results: Results showed that both personality and work-related stressors were associated with burnout dimensions. Neuroticism was a common predictor of all dimensions of burnout although in personal accomplishment had a different direction. Managing student misbehaviour and time constraints were found to systematically predict dimensions of burnout Conclusions: Teachers' individual characteristics as well as job related stressors should be taken into consideration when studying the burnout phenomenon. The fact that each dimension of the syndrome is predicted by different variables should not remain unnoticed especially when designing and implementing intervention programmes to reduce burnout in teachers.

  abstract = {Heywood cases, or negative variance estimates, are a common occurrence in factor analysis and latent variable structural equation models. Though they have several potential causes, structural misspecification is among the most important. This article explains how structural misspecification can lead to a Heywood case in the population, and provides several ways to test whether a negative error variance is a symptom of structural misspecification. The authors consider z-tests based on a variety of standard errors, confidence intervals, bootstrap resampling, and likelihood-ratio-type tests. In their discussion of z-tests, the authors demonstrate which of the standard errors are consistent under different kinds of misspecification. They also introduce new tests based on the scaled chi-square difference: the test on the boundary and the signed root of the scaled chi-square difference. A simulation study assesses the performance of these tests. The authors find that signed root tests and z-tests based on the empirical sandwich and the empirical bootstrap standard errors perform best in detecting negative error variances. They outperform z-tests based on the information matrix or distribution-robust standard errors.},

  abstract = {In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland hat in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten eine bemerkenswerte {\"O}ffnung von Bildungswegen im Sekundarschulsystem stattgefunden, die sich u.a. in der Entkopplung von Bildungsweg und Abschlusszertifikat ausdr{\"u}ckt. Diese Entkopplung bietet beachtliche Modernisierungschancen f{\"u}r das Schulsystem. Musterbeispiel f{\"u}r die {\"O}ffnung von Bildungswegen sind die beruflichen Gymnasien in Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg, in denen die allgemeine Hochschulreife erworben werden kann. Die TOSCA-Studie beschreibt die Zusammensetzung der Sch{\"u}lerschaft an allgemeinbildenden und beruflichen Gymnasien in Baden-W{\"u}rttemberg, analysiert die Vergleichbarkeit der Abschl{\"u}sse und untersucht die {\"U}berleitung in eine Berufsausbildung oder ein Universit{\"a}tsstudium. Die beruflichen Gymnasien Baden-W{\"u}rttembergs bieten einer traditionell eher gymnasialfernen Sch{\"u}lerschaft die M{\"o}glichkeit, mit einer berufsbezogenen fachlichen Schwerpunktsetzung das Abitur zu machen. Das Buch mit Ergebnissen aus der Studie Transformation des Sekundarschulsystems und akademische Karrieren (TOSCA) untersucht diese Form der {\"O}ffnung von Bildungswegen vor allem im Hinblick auf die Studierf{\"a}higkeit. TOSCA analysiert Eingangsunterschiede zu Beginn der gymnasialen Oberstufe an allgemeinbildenden und beruflichen Gymnasien, die Vergleichbarkeit der Abschl{\"u}sse und die erfolgreiche {\"U}berleitung in eine Berufsausbildung oder ein Universit{\"a}tsstudium. Im Einzelnen umfasst der vorliegende Band drei gr{\"o}ssere Teile. Der erste Teil geht auf den Hintergrund der TOSCA-Untersuchung ein.},

Angehende Lehrer stehen mit der zunehmenden Orientierung an Standards und Kompetenzen in der Lehrerausbildung vor der Aufgabe, professionsbezogenes p{\"a}dagogisches Wissen auszubilden. Ihre Lerngelegenheiten unterliegen jedoch weitgehend einer wissenschaftsimmanenten Systemstruktur. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird vermutet, dass sich ihr Wissenserwerb st{\"a}rker innerhalb von Subdisziplinen als entlang beruflicher Anforderungen {\"u}ber Subdisziplinen der Erziehungswissenschaft hinaus vollzieht. Anforderungs- und subdisziplinbezogene Strukturannahmen werden mithilfe eines Testinstruments zur Erfassung p{\"a}dagogischen Wissens an einer Stichprobe von 802 angehenden Lehrern modelliert. Die Ergebnisse geben Hinweise auf eine Struktur des p{\"a}dagogischen Wissens entlang erziehungswissenschaftlicher Subdisziplinen, die aber der anforderungsbezogenen Struktur nicht {\"u}berlegen ist. Implikationen f{\"u}r die erziehungswissenschaftliche Lehrerausbildung werden diskutiert. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;This contribution investigates which structural dimensions underlie future teachers' pedagogical knowledge. With the increasing orientation towards standards and competencies in teacher education future teachers are challenged by the task to acquire profession-related pedagogical knowledge. However, their opportunities to learn are predominantly structured by a system of scientific disciplines. Against this background, it is assumed that future teachers acquire knowledge within educational subdisciplines rather than being oriented towards professional tasks across educational subdisciplines. Assumptions on the structure of future teachers' knowledge oriented to discipline and profession are modelled with a standardized achievement test measuring pedagogical knowledge of future teachers. A sample of 802 future teachers is used. The results show that the pedagogical knowledge of future teachers can be structured around educational subdisciplines. However, the correspondent model is not superior to a model structuring the pedagogical knowledge around professional tasks. Implications for the educational component of teacher education are discussed. (DIPF/Orig.).},

  abstract = {For more than two decades, three components of teacher knowledge have been discussed, namely, content knowledge (CK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and general pedagogical knowledge (GPK). Although there is a growing body of analytic clarification and empirical testing with regard to CK and PCK, especially with a focus on mathematics teachers, hardly any attempt has been made to learn more about teachers' GPK. In the context of the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), Germany, Taiwan, and the United States worked on closing this research gap by conceptualizing a theoretical framework and developing a standardized test of GPK, which was taken by representative samples of future middle school teachers in these countries. Four task-based subdimensions of GPK and three cognitive subdimensions of GPK were distinguished in this test. TEDS-M data are used (a) to test the hypothesis that GPK is not homogenous but multidimensional and (b) to compare the achievement of U.S. future middle school teachers with future middle school teachers from Germany and Taiwan. The data revealed that U.S. future teachers were outperformed by both the other groups. They showed a relative strength in one of the cognitive subdimensions, generating strategies to perform in the classroom, indicating that in particular they had acquired procedural GPK during teacher education.},

  abstract = {Modelle professioneller Kompetenz von Lehrkr{\"a}ften differenzieren analytisch auf der einen Seite das Professionswissen, auf der anderen Seite motivational-affektive Charakteristika. Zusammenh{\"a}nge und die wechselseitige Bedingtheit solcher kognitiven und nicht-kognitiven Elemente wurden bislang in der Forschung jedoch weder theoretisch noch empirisch intensiv bearbeitet. Der Beitrag begegnet diesem Desiderat, indem Zusammenh{\"a}nge von berufsspezifischer Motivation mit p{\"a}dagogischem Wissen bei Lehramtsstudierenden auf der Basis einer repr{\"a}sentativen Stichprobe von Studienanf{\"a}ngern in Nordrhein-Westfalen untersucht werden. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass spezifische Berufswahlmotive (z.B. intrinsischer Wert) mit p{\"a}dagogischem Wissen statistisch signifikant korrelieren, die Zusammenh{\"a}nge jedoch klein sind. Korrelative Befunde wie auch eine pfadanalytische Modellierung von Berufswahlmotiven, Ma{\ss}e der allgemeinen Leistungsmotivation und der Lern-/Leistungsmotivation im Studium zeigen erwartungskonform, dass es sich bei Berufswahlmotiven um distale, bei Ma{\ss}en der Lern-/Leistungsmotivation im Studium um proximale motivationale Faktoren handelt, mit denen p{\"a}dagogisches Wissen assoziiert ist. Die Befunde werden mit Blick auf die Bedeutung der kognitiven und motivationalen Voraussetzungen von Lehramtsstudierenden f{\"u}r die Entwicklung professioneller Kompetenz in der ersten Phase der Lehrerbildung diskutiert.  
Models of the professional competence of teachers differentiate analytically between professional knowledge, on the one hand, and motivational-affective characteristics, on the other. However, the relations between and the reciprocal conditionality of such cognitive and non-cognitive elements has so far hardly been examined closely, neither theoretically nor empirically. The contribution meets this desideratum by examining the relation between job-specific motivation and pedagogical knowledge among students in teacher training on the basis of a representative sample of freshmen in North Rhine-Westphalia. The results show that, statistically, specific motives for the choice of profession (e.g. intrinsic value) correlate significantly with pedagogical knowledge; however, the ratios are rather small. As was expected, correlative findings as well as a path-analytical modeling of motives for the choice of profession, measures of general achievement motivation and of learning/achievement motivation during the course of studies show that motives for the choice of profession are distal factors, whereas measures of learning/achievement motivation during the course of studies are proximal motivational factors with which pedagogical knowledge is associated. The findings are discussed in view of the significance of cognitive and motivational prerequisites of students in teacher training for the development of professional competence during the first phase of teacher training.},

Therefore, information seekers have to decide whether they should accept knowledge claims they encounter online. This study analyses how information seekers' judgements of a source's credibility, trustworthiness, and instructional quality are affected by the source's professional affiliation and involvement in supporting studies. In a 2\,\texttimes\,2 between-subject online experiment, 143 participants watched an online video lecture in which an expert argued that organic food is superior to conventional food. The conditions varied in the experiment were the expert's professional affiliation and his involvement in the scientific studies that he presented as supporting evidence. Analyses showed that the information about the expert's professional affiliation and study involvement interacted as participants made their judgements about the source: When the expert was a lobbyist who referred to self-conducted studies, rather than a lobbyist who referred to studies conducted by other scientists, he was rated as less trustworthy; his information was rated as less credible; and his instructional qualities were rated as less positive. For scientists, this effect did not occur.},

It is thus crucial to visualize relevant data efficiently so that employees are able to extract relevant information most accurately and quickly. However, at present, information visualization research lacks a coherent and evidence based theoretical framework providing clear guidelines on how to design efficient visualizations. When it comes to the use of redundant elements in charts like commonly used data labels, cognitive fit theory and cognitive load theory make different predictions. Whereas the latter assumes that redundant labels generally reduce visualizations' efficiency due to increased cognitive load, cognitive fit theory predicts increased efficiency for some task types that shall be solved by means of the visualization.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, teachers--but also parents and politicians--voice dissatisfaction with the divide they experience between research and practice and the resulting minimal impact of teacher education (Ashton, 1996; Barone, Berliner, Blanchard, Casanova, \& McGowan, 1996). The problem seems to be perennial. More than a century ago, John Dewey pointed out a gap between theory and practice in education (Dewey, 1904), and he discussed possible approaches to bridging this gap (see also Shulman, 1998). During the 20th century, the focus was often on the question of how practice can be better linked to valuable research outcomes. To date, attention is more focused on how research outcomes can be better linked to practice. Probably, this has to do with the fact that all the attempts at enhancing the dissemination of research results have not led to a clear, successful, and generally accepted approach to bridging the research-practice divide and that, despite all these attempts, the gap between research and practice seems to have increased rather than diminished during the second part of the 20th century. In this article, the author discusses a few issues emerging from the six articles in this issue that put forward interesting and important perspectives on the gap between research and practice. Next, he proceeds to the question of what can be learned regarding the possibilities for bridging this gap. (ERIC)},

This is most true in northwest Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and Korea and least true in southern Europe, Brazil and Malaysia where teachers fall between the two views. \textbullet{} In the classroom, teachers in all countries put greater emphasis on ensuring that learning is well structured than on student-oriented activities which give them more autonomy. Both of these teaching practices are emphasised more than enhanced learning activities such as project work. This pattern is true in every country. \textbullet{} Co-operation by teachers in all countries more commonly takes the form of exchanging and co-ordinating ideas and information than direct professional collaboration such as team teaching. \textbullet{} At least half of teachers in most countries spend over 80\% of their lesson time on teaching and learning. However, one in four teachers in most countries lose at least 30\% of their lesson time, and some lose more than half, through disruptions and administrative tasks. This is closely associated with the classroom disciplinary climate. Country and school differences in this respect are less important than differences among teachers within schools. \textbullet{} Almost all Norwegian teachers report better than average relationships between teachers and students. In other countries, teacher-student relationships vary considerably. Only part of this variation is related to differences among schools. Even though teacher-student relations are often seen as a feature of schools as a whole, different teachers within schools perceive them differently.},

A number of experiments have taken place with data provided by the `informatics' course of the Hellenic Open University and a quite interesting conclusion is that the Naive Bayes algorithm can be successfully used. A prototype web based support tool, which can automatically recognize students with high probability of dropout, has been constructed by implementing this algorithm.},

The study's conceptual framework distinguishes two main areas of metaethical cognition (beliefs about the nature of moral judgments and conceptions of the process of moral judgment formation), and three metaethical stances (intuitionism, subjectivism, and transsubjectivism). In a sample of 200 adolescents (M 1/4 16.18 years, SD 1/4 2.41), these metaethical stances could be reliably identified by means of a semistructured interview procedure. Adolescents' metaethical stance was related to age, cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. Furthermore, significant differences in metaethical cognition were found between high school students and an expert group of university students with special training in moral philosophy. Overall, metaethical and epistemic stances were correlated substantially. Findings demonstrate that metaethical reasoning development is a structural analogue of epistemic development regarding factual knowledge. Implications for studies on moral development and for research addressing the domain specificity of epistemic reasoning development are discussed.},

The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

On the other hand, Bayesian methods for data analysis have not yet made much headway in cognitive science against the institutionalized inertia of 20th century null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Ironically, specific Bayesian models of cognition and perception may not long endure the ravages of empirical verification, but generic Bayesian methods for data analysis will eventually dominate. It is time that Bayesian data analysis became the norm for empirical methods in cognitive science. This article reviews a fatal flaw of NHST and introduces the reader to some benefits of Bayesian data analysis.

The authors argue that initially, the objective dimension dominates, to the exclusion of subjectivity; subsequently, the subjective dimension assumes an ascendant position and the objective is abandoned, and, finally, the 2 are coordinated. This progression, the authors further postulate, tends to occur in a systematic order across different judgment domains (personal taste, aesthetic, value, and truth), with the orders the reverse of one another in the 2 major transitions that constitute this progression. These predictions are supported in 2 studies among a sample of 7 groups of children, adolescents, and adults varying in age, education, and life experience. Subjectivity is most readily acknowledged in personal taste and aesthetic judgments and least readily in truth judgments. Once subjectivity is accepted and becomes dominant, objectivity is reintegrated in the reverse order, i.e., most readily with respect to truth judgments. Not predicted, however, was the finding that for a number of individuals, both transitions proved most difficult in the values domain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Regardless of the number of stages, positions, or perspectives, the sequence invariably suggests movement from a dualistic, objectivist view of knowledge to a more subjective, relativistic stance and ultimately to a contextual, constructivist perspective of knowing. In this chapter on epistemological thinking---and why it matters---the present authors identify the developmental tasks inherent in the growth of epistemological understanding. They suggest that it is this coordination of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowing that is the essence of epistemological development and describe their research in measuring the progression of this cognitive process from childhood to adulthood. Their work is an attempt to clarify and simplify our understanding of epistemological development and to situate it within our knowledge about cognitive development.

A series of studies is described in which assessments of intellectual values and epistemological beliefs were found to show similar patterns of variation across cultural and subcultural groups of parents and children. Such groups may play a role in highlighting to their youth the intrinsic value of intellectual engagement (versus its instrumental value in achieving individual recognition and status). Intrinsically valued intellectual engagement, we suggest, provides the firmest basis for sustaining intellectual motivation through adolescence and into adulthood. Developing mature epistemological understanding, moreover, is key to this enterprise. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The third is the ability to engage in skilled argumentation in the scientific domain, with an appreciation of argumentation as entailing the coordination of theory and evidence. We present new empirical data with respect to the first two of these competencies, supporting the claim that they are not well developed by early adolescence and warrant attention and provision of effective kinds of scaffolding.},

COACTIV applies a broad, innovative conceptualization of teacher competence to examine how mathematics teachers' knowledge, beliefs, motivational orientations, and self-regulation skills influence their instructional practice and teaching outcomes. Moreover, it gauges the effects of these teacher characteristics on student learning, as indexed by the progress of students in each class.~For this book, COACTIV study data relating to ~various aspects of teacher competence and classroom instruction from the perspective of both the teachers themselves and their students was collected and analyzed. Questions addressed and discussed include: What are the characteristics of successful teaching? What distinguishes teachers who succeed in their profession? How can the quality of instruction be improved? Written for researchers from a broad range of areas, such as educational psychology, general education, and mathematics education, this book effectively demonstrates how teacher competence relates directly to measurable student learning gains.},

Specifically, it examines how these aspects impact instruction and, in turn, student outcomes. In a nationally representative sample of 194 German secondary school mathematics classes, multiple measures were used to assess teacher competence, instructional quality, and students' achievement and motivation. The effect of teachers' professional competence on student outcomes was estimated in a 1-year repeated-measures design. Two-level structural equation models revealed positive effects of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, enthusiasm for teaching, and self-regulatory skills on instructional quality, which in turn affected student outcomes. In contrast, teachers' general academic ability did not affect their instruction. The multidimensional model of teachers' professional competence introduced in this article seems suited to stimulate further research on the personal indicators of teacher quality.

        Based on psychological theories of knowledge acquisition it is assumed that scientific contents, acquired as part of university training, are a fundamental condition for the subsequent acquisition of competencies for teachers. The starting hypothesis of the project was: Educational science contents and contexts outline a conceptual framework that teachers need in order to interpret and reflect on class and school events adequately and as such use it for their own competence development. To check this assumption, a theoretical model of the educational scientific knowledge contents was outlined in a first step. This model was initially developed on the basis of document and curriculum analyzes of educational sciences in teacher training. Following pilot studies, the main study was conducted in all study seminars in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) with 3,298 university graduates who were at the beginning of the second phase of their training (teaching practice). Part of the prospective teachers from the main study (n=362) participated in an intermediate survey after a year in teaching practice.},

  abstract = {Open Access (OA) is a model for publishing scholarly peer reviewed journals, made possible by the Internet. The full text of OA journals and articles can be freely read, as the publishing is funded through means other than subscriptions. Empirical research concerning the quantitative development of OA publishing has so far consisted of scattered individual studies providing brief snapshots, using varying methods and data sources. This study adopts a systematic method for studying the development of OA journals from their beginnings in the early 1990s until 2009. Because no comprehensive index of OA articles exists, systematic manual data collection from journal web sites was conducted based on journal-level data extracted from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Due to the high number of journals registered in the DOAJ, almost 5000 at the time of the study, stratified random sampling was used. A separate sample of verified early pioneer OA journals was also studied. The results show a very rapid growth of OA publishing during the period 1993\textendash{}2009. During the last year an estimated 191 000 articles were published in 4769 journals. Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18\% for the number of journals and 30\% for the number of articles. This can be contrasted to the reported 3,5\% yearly volume increase in journal publishing in general. In 2009 the share of articles in OA journals, of all peer reviewed journal articles, reached 7,7\%. Overall, the results document a rapid growth in OA journal publishing over the last fifteen years. Based on the sampling results and qualitative data a division into three distinct periods is suggested: The Pioneering years (1993\textendash{}1999), the Innovation years (2000\textendash{}2004), and the Consolidation years (2005\textendash{}2009).},

(N = 170) conceptions of learning from Jan Meyer?s Reflections on Learning Inventory, we carried out a qualitative study using a focus group interview of seven students. The purpose was to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of changes in students? conceptions of learning. However, the initial analysis of the data directed our attention to the epistemological aspects, and we continued the analysis by applying Bendixen and Rule?s Integrative Personal Epistemology Model. The students? educational experiences showed that their epistemological beliefs changed over a period of time from absolutism towards relativism and that the pedagogical environment played an important role in this process. On the basis of the study, we suggest that it is already possible to influence the advancement of university students? epistemological beliefs at an early stage in their studies.},

Statistical modelling showed continued acceleration in student achievement (four months in addition to expected progress) at a rate similar to the intervention. The school-based practices associated with sustainability were part of a process of change (rather than a specific instructional programme) comprising two dimensions -- organisational learning through ongoing inquiry into solving problems arising from teaching and learning and the development of professional learning communities to promote organisational learning. Effectiveness was enhanced by schools embedding the process into their normal school routines as part of a coherent instructional programme and the availability of expertise.

  abstract = {Schools with primarily indigenous and ethnic minorities in low socioeconomic areas have long been associated with low levels of achievement, particularly in literacy. This is true for New Zealand despite high levels of reading comprehension by international comparisons (e.g., PISA). Recent reviews of schooling improvement suggest small gains over the short term are possible with well-designed interventions, but for children in the middle primary school years, the criterion against which effective interventions need to be judged is sustained and systematic acceleration across levels of achievement in order to achieve equitable distributions of achievement. Plotting gains across time is also needed to examine whether "summer effects" can be overcome. The present quasi-experimental design study was a three-year research and development collaboration among schools, government, and researchers to raise reading comprehension through critical discussions of achievement and teacher observation data and linking research on effective comprehension practices to specific needs. The collaboration resulted in increased rates of achievement that were variable but sustained across three years. The growth model showed a step-like pattern with rapid gains over school months and a plateau over summer. Over three years this represented an average achievement gain across cohorts followed longitudinally of one year's progress in addition to expected progress over that period with stanine effect sizes of d = 0.62. The results show the significance of testing effects against the criterion of sustained and systematic achievement and the need to examine growth over multiple calendar years to better represent the pattern of gains.

Although these adaptive designs have little advantage over familiar group-sequential designs, our review also describes recent developments in adaptive designs that are both flexible and efficient. We also discuss the use of Bayesian designs, when the context of use demands control over operating characteristics (Type I and II errors) and correction of the bias of estimated treatment effects.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether a literacy intervention involving generic and content area literacy components can improve both achievement on a standardized reading test and the attainment of secondary school qualifications, and whether the intervention can be implemented by teachers in their regular classroom settings. We report on a design-based approach for whole-school improvement, the Learning Schools Model (LSM), which was implemented in seven schools with low secondary school qualification rates. The LSM's core premises are that instructional practices need to be developed from evidence about teaching and learning in specific contexts and that professional learning communities need to fine-tune their instructional practices through collaborative analysis of data. The study employed a quasi-experimental design within a design-based approach and included classroom observations and teacher and student surveys. Reading achievement postintervention was statistically significantly higher than the projected achievement levels had the intervention not occurred. Effect sizes for tracked cohorts were Cohen's d~=~0.50 and~0.62. The hierarchical linear model of reading achievement, which included students' attitudes toward reading, accounted for about 95\% of the total variance. The attainment of secondary school qualifications (measured by odds ratios) increased significantly compared with school attainment prior to the intervention. The rates of attaining these qualifications were faster than national rates. The results suggest that both generic and content area literacy instruction are required and that a strong foundation in generic literacy should be maintained. However, the appropriate blend of literacy instruction is determined by a profiling of teaching and learning needs. 本文旨在考查一项包含一般性及学科领域的读写干预教学,是否能够帮助学生提高标准化阅读测验的成绩及取得中学毕业证书资格的成绩,同时亦考查该项干预教学能否由教师在其日常教学环境中实施。本文作者报告,这项为求改善整个学校而使用基于调查设计研究方法的干预教学(学习学校模型)在七所中学毕业证书资格合格率低的学校里施行。学习学校模型的核心前提是:教学实践需要根据有关特定教学环境的学习成绩证据而发展出来,而专业学习社区需要通过协作式分析学习成绩资料来微调其教学实践。本研究使用基于调查设计内的准实验设计研究方法,并包括课堂观察及对教师和学生的调查。干预教学阶段后的阅读成绩,统计上显著地高于假设没有干预教学所预期的成绩水平。追踪研究实验群组的效应值为0.50和0.62。阅读成绩的阶层线性模型统计分析,其中包括学生对阅读之态度,可解释约占总方差的95\%。与干预教学阶段前相比,干预教学阶段后的中学毕业证书资格成绩(用比值比来衡量)有显著的提高,达到这些资格的进度比全国的进度更快。这些结果显示,一般性和学科领域的读写教学都是有需要的,稳健的一般性读写能力基础是有需要保持的。然而,适当的混合式读写教学,是根据教学与学习需要的分析证据而决定的。 Este estudio investiga si una intervenci{\'o}n de competencias que incluye componentes gen{\'e}ricos y de contenido puede mejorar tanto el {\'e}xito en un examen est{\'a}ndar de lectura como conseguir las cualificaciones para la escuela secundaria, y si la intervenci{\'o}n puede ser implementada por maestros en sus clases regulares. Les informamos sobre un acercamiento dise{\~n}ado para el mejoramiento de la escuela completa, el Modelo de Escuelas Aprendices (LSM por sus siglas en ingl{\'e}s), que fue implementado en siete escuelas con tasas bajas de cualificaci{\'o}n a la escuela secundaria. Las proposiciones claves del LSM son que las pr{\'a}cticas de ense{\~n}anza tienen que surgir de evidencia sobre los contextos espec{\'i}ficos de ense{\~n}anza y aprendizaje, y que las comunidades profesionales del aprendizaje tienen que afinar sus pr{\'a}cticas de ense{\~n}anza por medio del an{\'a}lisis colaborativo de la informaci{\'o}n. El estudio us{\'o} un dise{\~n}o casi experimental dentro de un acercamiento basado en el dise{\~n}o e incluy{\'o} observaciones en los salones de clase y encuestas de los maestros y los estudiantes. Los logros en la lectura despu{\'e}s de la intervenci{\'o}n resultaron ser significantemente m{\'a}s altos estad{\'i}sticamente que los resultados proyectados si no hubiese habido la intervenci{\'o}n. Los tama{\~n}os de los efectos de los cohortes que se observaron fueron d~=~0.50 y 0.62 de Cohen. El modelo lineal jer{\'a}rquico de {\'e}xito lector que incluye la actitud de los estudiantes a la lectura constituy{\'o} casi el 95\% de la variaci{\'o}n total. El conseguir las cualificaciones para la escuela secundaria (medido por raz{\'o}n de probabilidades) aument{\'o} significantemente comparado con lo que se lograba antes de la intervenci{\'o}n. Las tasas de lograr estas cualificaciones fueron m{\'a}s r{\'a}pidas que las tasas nacionales. Los resultados sugieren que se necesitan tanto la instrucci{\'o}n de competencias gen{\'e}ricas como la de contenido, y que una base fuerte en competencias gen{\'e}ricas debe ser mantenida. Sin embargo, la mezcla apropiada de instrucci{\'o}n de competencias se determina por medio de la creaci{\'o}n de un cuadro de las necesidades de ense{\~n}anza y de aprendizaje. تفحص هذه الورقة قدرة تدخُّل تعلُّميّ يشمل مكوّنات مجال المحتوى والمجال العمومي على تحسين الإنجاز في امتحان قراءة قياسي وكذلك تحسين مؤهلات مدرسة ثانوية ونسأل إذا استطاع الأساتذة تنفيذ التدخل في صفوفهم العادية. لقد أفدنا بمدخل مبني على التصميم لتحسين المدرسة بإكمالها يسمّى نموذج المدارس التعلمية الذي تم تنفيذه في سبع مدارس ذات مستويات مؤهلات منخفضة. وعليه فمبادئ نموذج المدارس التعلمية تقوم على أن لابد من تطوير ممارسات تعليمية على أساس براهين التعلم والتعليم في سياقات معينة وأن مجتمعات التعلم المهني لابد لها من تضبيط ممارساتها التعليمية بواسطة تحاليل مشتركة للمعطيات. وقد استخدمت هذه الدراسة تصميم شبه اختباري من ضمن مدخل مبني على التصميم وشملت ملاحظات الصف واستفتاءات الأساتذة والطلاب. وجدير بالذكر أن إنجاز القراءة ما بعد التدخل كان أعلى إحصائياً من مستويات الإنجاز المتوقعة في حالة لم يتم التدخل. لقد بلغت أحجام تأثير المجموعات تحت المراقبة على مقياس كوهن الفرق = 0.50 و0.62 وقد بلغ نموذج إنجاز القراءة الخطي الهرمي الذي تضمنت عواطف الطلاب تجاه القراءة، إلى ما يعادل 95\% من المتغير الشمولي. إن إنجاز مؤهلات مدارس ثانوية (تنقاس عن طريق نسب الأرجحية) ازداد ازدياداً كبيراً بالمقارنة مع إنجاز المدرسة قبل التدخل. في حقيقة الأمر نسب إنجاز هذه المؤهلات تجاوزت سرعة النسب الوطنية. تشير النتائج إلى أن كلاً من المجال العمومي ومجال المحتوى في تعليم القراءة والكتابة ضروريان وأن أساساً قوياً في مجال التعلم العمومي ينبغي صيانته. غير أن الخليط المناسب لتعليم القراءة والكتابة يتحدد من خلال حصر حاجات التعليم والتعلم على حد سواء.

Ce texte examine la question de savoir si une intervention de litt{\'e}ratie comportant des aspects g{\'e}n{\'e}riques et des aspects avec un contenu propre {\`a} un domaine particulier permet d'am{\'e}liorer {\`a} la fois les r{\'e}sultats {\`a} un test standard de lecture et d'obtenir un dipl{\^o}me de fin d'{\'e}tudes secondaires, et si cette intervention peut {\^e}tre r{\'e}alis{\'e}e par des enseignants dans une situation scolaire ordinaire. Il s'agit d'un plan de recherche visant l'{\'e}cole enti{\`e}re, le Learning Schools Model (LSM), qui a {\'e}t{\'e} mis en place dans sept {\'e}coles pr{\'e}sentant de faibles taux d'obtention du dipl{\^o}me final. Les pr{\'e}misses de base du LSM sont que les pratiques p{\'e}dagogiques doivent {\^e}tre d{\'e}velopp{\'e}es {\`a} partir d'un enseignement et d'un apprentissage ayant un contexte sp{\'e}cifique et que les communaut{\'e}s d'apprentissage professionnel doivent affiner leurs pratiques p{\'e}dagogiques en recourant {\`a} une analyse coop{\'e}rative des donn{\'e}es. La recherche a utilis{\'e} un plan quasi-exp{\'e}rimental au sein d'une m{\'e}thode fond{\'e}e sur un plan de sondage et comportait des observations de classe et des questionnaires pour les {\'e}l{\`e}ves. Les r{\'e}sultats en lecture apr{\`e}s l'intervention ont {\'e}t{\'e} statistiquement plus {\'e}lev{\'e}s que le niveau attendu si l'intervention n'avait pas eu lieu. La taille des effets pour le d de Cohen pour les cohortes {\'e}tudi{\'e}es~est de 0.50 et 0.62. Le mod{\`e}le hi{\'e}rarchique lin{\'e}aire de r{\'e}ussite en lecture, qui inclut les attitudes des {\'e}l{\`e}ves envers la lecture, rend compte d'environ 95\% de la variance totale. La r{\'e}ussite aux dipl{\^o}mes de fin d'{\'e}tudes secondaires (mesur{\'e}e par des rapports de probabilit{\'e}) ont augment{\'e} significativement par rapport aux taux avant l'intervention. Les taux de r{\'e}ussite {\`a} ces dipl{\^o}mes ont {\'e}t{\'e} plus rapides que les pourcentages nationaux. Ces r{\'e}sultats permettent de penser qu'il est n{\'e}cessaire d'effectuer un enseignement g{\'e}n{\'e}rique aussi bien qu'un enseignement propre {\`a} un domaine particulier et qu'il faut conserver de solides bases en litt{\'e}ratie. Toutefois m{\'e}langer comme il convient les enseignements de litt{\'e}ratie demande un profilage des besoins d'enseignement et d'apprentissage.},

Quasi-experimental designs were used to test for intervention impact. The intervention improved achievement in reading comprehension, writing and high school qualifications. Effect sizes were generally higher than international comparisons. The data use PD involved collaboratively analyzing data to determine the achievement problems; identifying and testing the causes of the problems using theory evaluation principles; and co-creating solutions. The relative contribution of the data use PD to the intervention and the importance of content knowledge are discussed.},

  abstract = {Interpreting and creating graphs plays a critical role in scientific practice. The K-12 Next Generation Science Standards call for students to use graphs for scientific modeling, reasoning, and communication. To measure progress on this dimension, we need valid and reliable measures of graph understanding in science. In this research, we designed items to measure graph comprehension, critique, and construction and developed scoring rubrics based on the knowledge integration (KI) framework. We administered the items to over 460 middle school students. We found that the items formed a coherent scale and had good reliability using both item response theory and classical test theory. The KI scoring rubric showed that most students had difficulty linking graphs features to science concepts, especially when asked to critique or construct graphs. In addition, students with limited access to computers as well as those who speak a language other than English at home have less integrated understanding than others. These findings point to the need to increase the integration of graphing into science instruction. The results suggest directions for further research leading to comprehensive assessments of graph understanding.},

  abstract = {The North American carnivorous pitcher plant genus Sarracenia (Sarraceniaceae) is a relatively young clade ({$<$}3 million years ago) displaying a wide range of morphological diversity in complex trapping structures. This recently radiated group is a promising system to examine the structural evolution and diversification of carnivorous plants; however, little is known regarding evolutionary relationships within the genus. Previous attempts at resolving the phylogeny have been unsuccessful, most likely due to few parsimony-informative sites compounded by incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we applied a target enrichment approach using multiple accessions to assess the relationships of Sarracenia species. This resulted in 199 nuclear genes from 75 accessions covering the putative 8-11 species and 8 subspecies/varieties. In addition, we recovered 42. kb of plastome sequence from each accession to estimate a cpDNA-derived phylogeny. Unsurprisingly, the cpDNA had few parsimony-informative sites (0.5\%) and provided little information on species relationships. In contrast, use of the targeted nuclear loci in concatenation and coalescent frameworks elucidated many relationships within Sarracenia even with high heterogeneity among gene trees. Results were largely consistent for both concatenation and coalescent approaches. The only major disagreement was with the placement of the purpurea complex. Moreover, results suggest an Appalachian massif biogeographic origin of the genus. Overall, this study highlights the utility of target enrichment using multiple accessions to resolve relationships in recently radiated taxa.},

The shipping industry is a valuable natural laboratory for the study of patterns of compliance and governance in late modernity because it is characterised both by highly developed polycentric governance structures and by globalising economic processes including vertically disaggregated global value chains, outsourcing and offshoring. Segmented markets have permitted some blue riband' companies to operate a social license beyond compliance', and that such social licenses are more extensive in respect of environment policies than in health and safety policies that may be attributed to supply chain influences. Ship operators' compliance is seen as a combination of instrumental compliance, normative compliance, a taken for granted culture of compliance and corporate policies of labour-force governance. A taken for granted culture of compliance is identified as the main reason for compliance with the new low-sulphur regulations, which are currently (uncharacteristically) subject to only limited enforcement effort.},

  abstract = {The prevailing view in the study of children's developing theories of mind is that the 4-year-old's newfound understanding of false belief is the single developmental milestone marking entry into an adult "folk psychology." We argue instead that there are at least two such watershed events. Children first develop a "copy theory" that equates the mind with a recording device capable of producing either faithful or flawed representations of reality and according to which mental states are determined entirely by the flow of information into the mind. Only later, in the early school years, do children come to appreciate, as do adults, that the mind itself can contribute to the content of mental states. This later-arriving "Interpretive Theory of Mind" allows an appreciation of the capacity for constructively interpreting and misinterpreting reality. The main finding from the six studies reported here is that children who otherwise demonstrate a clear understanding that beliefs can be false (and so deserve to be credited with a theory of mind), can nevertheless fail to appreciate even the most basic aspects of interpretation: that despite exposure to precisely the same information, two persons can still end up holding sharply different opinions about what is the self-same reality. What these studies reveal is that an interpretive theory of mind is different from, and later arriving than, an appreciation of the possibility of false belief, and contrary to competing claims, this interpretive theory actually makes its first appearance during, but not before, the early school years. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {How do children use informant niceness, meanness, and expertise when choosing between informant claims and crediting informants with knowledge? In Experiment 1, preschoolers met two experts providing conflicting claims for which only one had relevant expertise. Five-year-olds endorsed the relevant expert's claim and credited him with knowledge more often than 3-year-olds. In Experiment 2, niceness/meanness information was added. Although children most strongly preferred the nice relevant expert, the children often chose the nice irrelevant expert when the relevant one was mean. In Experiment 3, a mean expert was paired with a nice non-expert. Although this nice informant had no expertise, preschoolers continued to endorse his claims and credit him with knowledge. Also noteworthy, children in all three experiments seemed to struggle more to choose the relevant expert's claim than to credit him with knowledge. Together, these experiments demonstrate that niceness/meanness information can powerfully influence how children evaluate informants.},

The responses of 731 European science students in upper secondary school and undergraduate programmes to two written diagnostic questions are analysed for consistency.

There is evidence that the majority of students in this sample draw upon different epistemological representations in different contexts.

The purpose of the current article is to expose researchers to the various issues surrounding the use of IRR and IRA indices often used in conjunction with multilevel models.

  abstract = {The term graphical perception refers to the part played by visual perception in analyzing graphs. Computer graphics have stimulated interest in the perceptual pros and cons of different formats for displaying data. One way of evaluating the effectiveness of a display is to measure the efficiency (as defined by signal-detection theory) with which an observer extracts information from the graph. We measured observers' efficiencies in detecting differences in the means or variances of pairs of data sets sampled from Gaussian distributions. Sample size ranged from 1 to 20 for viewing times of 0.3 or 1 sec. The samples were displayed in three formats: numerical tables, scatterplots, and luminance-coded displays. Efficiency was highest for the scatterplots (approximately equal to 60\% for both means and variances) and was only weakly dependent on sample size and exposure time. The pattern of results suggests parallel perceptual computation in which a constant proportion of the available information is used. Efficiency was lowest for the numerical tables and depended more strongly on sample size and viewing time. The results suggest serial processing in which a fixed amount of the available information is processed in a given time.},

When a teacher is observed in multiple classrooms, his or her observation ratings may vary across classrooms. In that case, using ratings from one classroom per teacher may not be adequate to represent a teacher's instructional quality. Drawing on the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) dataset, this study examined the variation of a teacher's classroom observation ratings across his or her multiple classrooms. The results indicate that the math classrooms accounted for 4.9 to 14.7\% of the variance in the classroom observation ratings and English language arts (ELA) classrooms accounted for 6.7 to 15.5\% of the variance in the ratings. The results of this study suggest that teachers' multiple classrooms should be taken into consideration when classroom observation ratings are used to evaluate teachers in high-stakes settings.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are used in behavioral research to analyze hierarchical data. Hierarchical data can be repeated measures data (e.g., repeated assessments nested within study participants), longitudinal data (e.g., longitudinal data collected at staggered time intervals, nested within individual participants), or multilevel data (e.g., group-randomized clinical trials in which participants are nested within psychotherapy groups; individuals within couple dyads in couples therapy; students nested within classes; and classes nested within schools). An important statistical issue is that data units that belong to the same clusters are likely to show correlated outcome endpoints. This Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) must be taken into account in the data analysis. This chapter contains an example analysis from Flay et al. (1995) in testing the efficacy of behavioral interventions in a group-randomized trial. This chapter is organized as follows. A brief summary of the Flay et al. (1995) study design and data structure is presented first. Next we present data visualization and exploratory analyses. The intervention effects are tested in a linear mixed-effects model. The same model is also explained in a multilevel modeling approach as described in Bryk and Raudenbush (2002). Data analyses primarily rely on the lme4 package by Douglas Bates, Martin Maechler, and Ben Bolker; additional analyses are done using the nlme package by Jose Pinheiro, Douglas Bates, Saikat DebRoy, Deepayan Sarkar, and the R Core team.

A matrix representation of the linear mixed model is described in Sect. 11.6, in part because the matrix notation is the standard modeling notation in the literature.

In a two-independent-samples scenario, Cohen's (1988) standardized mean difference (d) is the most popular ES, but its accuracy relies on two assumptions: normality and homogeneity of variances. Five other ESs---the unscaled robust d (d r * ; Hogarty \& Kromrey, 2001), scaled robust d (d r ; Algina, Keselman, \& Penfield, Psychological Methods, 10, 317--328, 2005), point-biserial correlation (r pb ; McGrath \& Meyer, Psychological Methods, 11, 386--401, 2006), common-language ES (CL; Cliff, Psychological Bulletin, 114, 494--509, 1993), and nonparametric estimator for CL (A w ; Ruscio, Psychological Methods, 13, 19--30, 2008)---may be robust to violations of these assumptions, but no study has systematically evaluated their performance. Thus, in this simulation study the performance of these six ESs was examined across five factors: data distribution, sample, base rate, variance ratio, and sample size. The results showed that A w and d r were generally robust to these violations, and A w slightly outperformed d r . Implications for the use of A w and d r in real-world research are discussed.},

  abstract = {In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the use of maximum likelihood (ML) assumes that the observed indicators follow a continuous and multivariate normal distribution, which is not appropriate for ordinal observed variables. Robust ML (MLR) has been introduced into CFA models when this normality assumption is slightly or moderately violated. Diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV), on the other hand, is specifically designed for ordinal data. Although WLSMV makes no distributional assumptions about the observed variables, a normal latent distribution underlying each observed categorical variable is instead assumed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to compare the effects of different configurations of latent response distributions, numbers of categories, and sample sizes on model parameter estimates, standard errors, and chi-square test statistics in a correlated two-factor model. The results showed that WLSMV was less biased and more accurate than MLR in estimating the factor loadings across nearly every condition. However, WLSMV yielded moderate overestimation of the interfactor correlations when the sample size was small or/and when the latent distributions were moderately nonnormal. With respect to standard error estimates of the factor loadings and the interfactor correlations, MLR outperformed WLSMV when the latent distributions were nonnormal with a small sample size of N = 200. Finally, the proposed model tended to be over-rejected by chi-square test statistics under both MLR and WLSMV in the condition of small sample size N = 200.},

Even though the construct is clearer and relevant data are being collected, there are important theoretical and methodological issues that need further clarification. One of them is the debate about the domain generality-specificity of epistemological beliefs. I argue that there are both theoretical and methodological difficulties that hinder a more fruitful approach of the domain generality-specificity debate. Differences in goals and scope of the diverse conceptualizations about epistemological beliefs and how they devise the role of content-domain and context are a major source of difficulties. Methodological problems such as whether such epistemological beliefs can be measured "in isolation"-free of content and context influence-or the impossibility of collecting direct measures of epistemological beliefs may influence how the domain generality-specificity question is approached. Some suggestions about how these difficulties may be overcome are developed. The relevance of exploring epistemological beliefs across domains and across contexts is emphasized. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Individual raters vary the severity of their ratings in a manner dependent upon a wide array of factors. Most efforts intended to secure reliable and valid ratings across judges assume that the goal is to obtain identical ratings from different judges for the same performance. In contrast to these approaches, probabilistic conjoint measurement facilitates observation and calibration of differences in judge severity, making it possible to account for these differences in the interpretation of the assigned ratings. This chapter addresses issues in the application of Facets analyses to writing assessment, aesthetic judgment, and the evaluation of public speaking ability.},

We contribute a compar- ative analysis of different colormap types, with a focus on comparing single- and multi-hue schemes. We present a suite of experiments in which subjects perform relative distance judgments among color triplets drawn systematically from each of four single-hue and five multi-hue colormaps. We characterize speed and accuracy across each colormap, and identify conditions that degrade performance. We also find that a combination of perceptual color space and color naming measures more accurately predict user performance than either alone, though the overall accuracy is poor.

  abstract = {A challenge to successful teaching involves knowing how to address students' motivational and cognitive processes in relation to appropriate instruction. Some research has revealed that school tasks are important factors affecting student self-efficacy, motivation, cognition, and participation in instruction and learning. More understanding of the interaction between aspects of motivation, instruction, learning, and performance through a temporal analysis of problem solving in a normal classroom context is needed. This study traced the self-efficacy judgments of an experimental group of 89 grade ten students in a sectarian school as they worked on two differently designed learning tasks in their regular science class. The first task was ill structured. This task gave students significant choices about how to complete it, did not have identifiable steps or sub-goals, required students to search for and gather their own information and resources, and did not include specific criteria for grading. The second task was well structured. It was structured with particular sub-tasks, came with a packet of necessary resources, and included specific grading criteria. The experimental group and a comparison sample of 358 students from four public schools were also administered measures assessing their epistemological beliefs and perceptions of task or course difficulty. The main objectives of the study were to note differences in reported levels of self-efficacy for learning, self efficacy for performance, and epistemological beliefs according to the structure of each task and to study how these related to achievement. It was anticipated that most students would demonstrate significantly lower performance scores, lower and more unstable perceptions of self-efficacy for learning, self-efficacy for performance, and more harmful beliefs about learning and knowledge in the context of an ill-structured task than a well structured task. Self-efficacy for learning was expected to be lower than self-efficacy for performance on both tasks. Epistemological beliefs of the experimental, sample appeared to vary considerably from the comparison group so this variable was not examined further. Other results of the study support some of the hypotheses. Students reported significantly higher levels of self-efficacy for the well-structured task. Academic achievement and self-efficacy for learning were more predictive of achievement on the ill-structured task. Self-efficacy for learning was significantly lower, less stable, and more predictive of task achievement than self-efficacy for performance especially in the early phases of each task. These and other results suggest that features in both tasks may be difficult for students particularly early in task engagement when levels of self-efficacy for performance and learning differ most. Implications about the influence of each measured construct on achievement and impressions of task difficulty were discussed in hopes of bridging the theoretical gap between students' motivational and cognitive processes and constructive learning tasks.

In this paper we present, firstly, an expanded conceptualisation of teachers' assessment work. Drawing on research on teacher identity, we posit that teachers' identity as professionals, beliefs about assessment, disposition towards enacting assessment, and perceptions of their role as assessors are all significant for their assessment work. We term this reconceptualisation Teacher Assessment Identity (TAI). Secondly, in support of this conceptual work, we present findings from a systematic review of self-report scales on teacher assessment literacy and teacher identity related to assessment. The findings demonstrate that such scales and previous research exploring teacher assessment practices have paid limited attention to what we identify as essential and broader dimensions of TAI. We share our reconceptualisation and analyses to encourage others to consider teacher assessment work more broadly in their research.},

  abstract = {F{\"u}r die systematische Unterrichtsbeobachtung werden h{\"a}ufig hoch inferente Sch{\"a}tzverfahren zur Beurteilung der Unterrichtsqualit{\"a}t eingesetzt. Deren Validit{\"a}t wird aber vielfach in Frage gestellt, da sie ein hohes Ausma{\ss} an Schlussfolgerungen aufseiten der Beobachter erfordern. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie bestand daher darin, die G{\"u}te hoch inferenter Beobachtungssysteme im Rahmen der PERLE-Studie exemplarisch zu {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen, indem Zusammenh{\"a}nge zu niedrig inferent erfassten Beobachtungsdaten analysiert wurden. Anhand der Beispiele "Einsatz von Lob" und "St{\"o}rungsfreiheit" kann gezeigt werden, dass grunds{\"a}tzlich Zusammenh{\"a}nge zwischen den auf unterschiedliche Art erfassten Daten bestehen. Allerdings f{\"a}llt bei hoch inferenten Ratings die Zuordnung zu den einzelnen Ratingstufen nicht immer eindeutig aus. Zudem deutet sich an, dass die H{\"o}he des Zusammenhangs zwischen niedrig und hoch inferent erfassten Beobachtungsdaten von der Art der Definition der hoch inferent erfassten Merkmale mit bedingt wird. (DIPF/Orig.).;;;Often, highly inferential estimation procedures for the assessment of the quality of teaching are used in the systematic observation of lessons. The validity of these procedures, however, is frequently questioned since they require a high degree of inferences on the part of the observer. The aim of the present study thus is to examine exemplarily the quality of highly inferential systems of observation within the framework of the PERLE-study by analyzing coherences with lowly inferential observation data. Based on the examples of "the use of praise" and "no disturbances", it can be shown that, basically, coherences do exist between data collected through different procedures. However, in the case of highly inferential ratings, the allocation to individual rating levels is not always unequivocal. Furthermore, it appears that the degree of coherence between lowly and highly inferential observation data also depends on how the characteristics collected through highly inferential procedures have been defined.

The pre-service Home Economics teachers in the 3rd year of their studies had just completed their first class of teaching experience in contrast to the pre-service teachers from the 4th year of their faculty studies, who had conducted more teaching lessons. The results showed that the 4th-year pre-service teachers had fewer doubts and problems concerning the planning and conducting of a lesson. They also statistically significantly agreed that they are sufficiently prepared to teach than the 3rd-year pre-service teachers are. The results showed that the majority of the pre-service teachers agreed that the feedback from their colleagues was helpful for their professional development. The results suggest the importance of practical teaching experience in the context of professional development and the intention to continue a career in education. However, the results also revealed some critical points in the teacher's development of competency. The results suggest problems related to the application of theoretical knowledge on the children's development in practice and pro problems related to classroom management in specific situations.

(DIPF/Orig.).;;The author investigates in how far school pedagogy - in dealing with its central topics - has managed to distance itself from the practical demands of the teaching profession and to enforce specific approaches determined by theorizing and empirical research. By specifically focusing on the concept of teaching, the author examines whether a change from a rather profession-related use of the term towards a disciplinary use grounded on scientific theories can be shown to have occurred. Subject of this investigation are definitions of the concept of teaching as they appear in pedagogical reference books published between 1949 and 2007. The findings are significant both for educational science and for empirical scientific research: on the one hand, they reveal that school pedagogy has steadily clung to a practice-oriented concept of teaching, atypical of scientific disciplines. On the other hand, they show that the sounding of a discipline has to go beyond surveying general scientific indicators by including content-related analyses of relevant communication.

In this paper, we demonstrate the principles and application of multilevel factor analysis using a dataset from \textbackslash{}nhomework research (1712 students in 98 classes). As expected, the three factors under investigation (homework quality, teachers' \textbackslash{}nhomework control, and effective use of learning time in French lessons) were empirically distinguishable at both the student and the \textbackslash{}nclass level.

However, studying the effects of the learning environment presents a series of methodological challenges. This article discusses three crucial elements in research that uses student reports to gauge the impact of the learning environment on student outcomes. First, from a conceptual point of view, it is argued that ratings aggregated at the relevant level (e.g., class or school level), and not individual student ratings, are of primary interest in these studies. Second, the reliability of aggregated student ratings must be routinely assessed before these perceptions are related to outcome variables. Third, researchers conducting multilevel analyses need to make very clear which centering option was chosen for the predictor variables. This article shows that conclusions about the impact of learning environments can be substantially affected by the choice of a specific centering option for the individual student ratings. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A major problem of contextual analyses in the social sciences is that there is no error-free measurement of constructs. In the present article, 2 types of error occurring in multilevel data when estimating contextual effects are distinguished: unreliability that is due to measurement error and unreliability that is due to sampling error. The fact that studies may or may not correct for these 2 types of error can be translated into a 2 \texttimes{} 2 taxonomy of multilevel latent contextual models comprising 4 approaches: an uncorrected approach, partial correction approaches correcting for either measurement or sampling error (but not both), and a full correction approach that adjusts for both sources of error. It is shown mathematically and with simulated data that the uncorrected and partial correction approaches can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the number of indicators, and the size of the factor loadings. However, the simulation study also shows that partial correction approaches can outperform full correction approaches when the data provide only limited information in terms of the L2 construct (i.e., small number of groups, low intraclass correlation). A real-data application from educational psychology is used to illustrate the different approaches.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence to show that teachers' epistemic cognition is related to how they conceive of and engage in teaching; therefore it is important that teachers develop adaptive epistemic cognition. This article provides an overview of the different ways of theorizing and investigating changes in epistemic cognition for teaching and learning. A growing body of research shows that explicit reflection on epistemic cognition may be a useful way to promote change. Drawing on the work of Lunn Brownlee and Schraw and the Advanced Study Colloquium group described in the introduction to this special issue, we extend the concept of explicit reflection to encompass reflexive thinking. Reflexivity involves critical thinking that evaluates multiple perspectives in context and leads to specific action in the classroom. The 3R-EC Framework (Reflection, Reflexivity and Resolved Action for Epistemic Cognition) for theorizing change in epistemic cognition is described and exemplified in the contexts of classroom practice and teachers' professional learning},

  abstract = {Matching on the propensity score is widely used to estimate the effect of an exposure in observational studies. However, the quality of the matches can be affected by decisions made during the matching process, particularly the order in which subjects are selected for matching and the maximum permitted difference between matched subjects (the "caliper"). This study used simulations to explore the effects of these decisions on both the imbalance of covariates and the closeness of matching, while allowing the numbers of potential matches and strengths of association between the confounding variable and the exposure to vary. It was found that, without a caliper, substantial bias was possible, particularly with a relatively small reservoir of potential matches and strong confounder-exposure association. Use of the recommended caliper reduced the bias considerably, but bias remained if subjects were selected by increasing or decreasing propensity score. A tighter caliper led to greatly reduced bias and closer matches, although some subjects could not be matched. This study suggests that a narrow caliper can improve the performance of propensity score matching. In situations where it is impossible to find appropriate matches for all exposed subjects, it is better to select subjects in order of the best available matches, rather than increasing or decreasing the propensity score.},

  abstract = {Programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.},

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.

  abstract = {Student evaluation of teaching (SET) is now common practice across higher education, with the results used for both course improvement and quality assurance purposes. While much research has examined the validity of SETs for measuring teaching quality, few studies have investigated the factors that influence student participation in the SET process. This study aimed to address this deficit through the analysis of an SET respondent pool at a large Canadian research-intensive university. The findings were largely consistent with available research (showing influence of student gender, age, specialisation area and final grade on SET completion). However, the study also identified additional influential course-specific factors such as term of study, course year level and course type as statistically significant. Collectively, such findings point to substantively significant patterns of bias in the characteristics of the respondent pool. Further research is needed to specify and quantify the impact (if any) on SET scores. We conclude, however, by recommending that such bias does not invalidate SET implementation, but instead should be embraced and reported within standard institutional practice, allowing better understanding of feedback received, and driving future efforts at recruiting student respondents.},

In Study 1, confidence limits based on the distribution of the product are more accurate than methods based on an assumed normal distribution but confidence limits are still imbalanced. Study 2 demonstrates that more accurate confidence limits are obtained using resampling methods, with the bias-corrected bootstrap the best method overall.},

In this context, we discuss how familiarity with the processes used to justify knowledge claims within specific disciplinary communities can provide useful tools to develop the kind of adaptive and consistent thinking that characterize competence in different domains and how this focus may aid the identification of characteristics common across domains. We use our empirical exploration of adolescents' development of competence in the domain of history to illustrate the implications of this theoreti- cal framework, to highlight the relations between domain-specific epistemic beliefs and kind of understanding that students built as a result of reading multiple texts, and to suggest what pedagogical practices may have influenced students' orientations toward knowing in these three history classes.},

Thuringia implemented mandatory tests for secondary schools based on competency modeling and performance data controlled for socioeconomic variables. In comparison to Thuringia, mandatory testing in Baden-Wurttemberg is rather simple, not based on competency modeling and performance feedback is not controlled for socio- economic variables. Drawing on a model of quality features of school performance feedback systems, it was hypothesized that mandatory testing in Thuringia leads to higher teacher evaluation of mandatory testing and usefulness of performance feedback. Analysis of quantitative survey data for math teachers (n \textonequarter{} 357) showed that teachers in Thuringia rather accept mandatory testing and describe performance feedback information as more useful for educational diagnosis, student tutoring, and repetition.

  abstract = {Computer-assisted formative assessments with multiple-tier items are a valid instrument for diagnosing students' conceptual understanding in learning domains with well-structured declarative knowledge (e.g. science education). However, it is unknown how feedback on multiple-tier items can improve learning success. Therefore, we assessed (1) predictors of students' perception and use of elaborated feedback, and (2) if feedback content (elaborated, verification, control) matters in explaining students' achievement in post- and retention tests. We developed computer-assisted formative tests for a teaching unit on evolutionary adaptations. Three treatment groups were employed with varying feedback content: Treatment 1 (T1) was an elaborated instruction-based feedback, T2 was a dichotomous verification feedback, and T3 (control) consisted of reading appropriate texts (no formative assessment and no feedback). Afterwards, T1 was separated into one subgroup with pupils who used the feedback thoroughly (T1A) and a subgroup that did not use the feedback (T1B). Ten secondary classrooms were used and 261 pupils participated in this study. Each student in each classroom was randomly assigned to one treatment group. Correlation and univariate regression analysis showed that perception and use of elaborated feedback were related to intrinsic motivation and self-reported grades. Multivariate analysis of covariance was applied to check treatment effects on post-tests and retention tests as dependent variables. Results revealed that verification feedback (T2) and elaborated feedback when students did use it (T1A) was superior to no feedback (T3) and elaborated feedback when students did not use it (T1B). Implications for the design of multiple-tier diagnostic assessments are discussed.},

The lineup protocol enables statistical significance testing of visual findings, bridging the gulf between exploratory and inferential statistics. In this article, inferential methods for statistical graphics are developed further by refining the terminology of visual inference and framing the lineup protocol in a context that allows direct comparison with conventional tests in scenarios when a conventional test exists. This framework is used to compare the performance of the lineup protocol against conventional statistical testing in the scenario of fitting linear models. A human subjects experiment is conducted using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that the lineup protocol performs comparably with the conventional tests, and expectedly outperforms them when data are contaminated, a scenario where assumptions required for performing a conventional test are violated.

We asked our participants why the protagonists disagreed, which one was right, whether the dispute could be resolved, and if so how. Analysis of changes with age in their judgments as to the resolvability of the issues, and their reasons for believing one or another protagonist, revealed increasing awareness of the complexity of both the outer world of objective "reality" and the inner worlds of individual knowers, and a deeper understanding of the ways in which the two worlds intersect in the creation of knowledge. Issues of "fact" and "opinion" became less sharply differentiated as the act of knowing became less reactive and more constructive. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper indicates that SEEQ measures nine distinct components of teaching effectiveness that have been identified in both student ratings and faculty self evaluations of their own teaching. Reliability is good when based upon 10 to 15 or more student response; The ratings have successfully been validated against the retrospective ratings of former students, student learning as measured by objective examination, affective course consequences, and staff self evaluations of their own teaching effectiveness. Suspected sources of bias to the ratings have been shown to have little impact. Feedback from student ratings, particularly when coupled with a candid discussion with an external consultant, produced improvement in both subsequent ratings and student learning.},

Separate factor analyses of 6 groups of courses each clearly identified the evaluation factors that SEEQ was designed to measure, demonstrating the replicability and generality of the factors. The SEEQ factors were then correlated with a set of 16 student/course/instructor characteristics (e.g., class size, expected grades, teacher rank) in each group of courses. These correlations were typically small, and proportion of variance in the ratings that could be predicted by the combined set of characteristics (based on stepwise multiple regression) varied between .08 and .20 in the 6 groups of courses. Most of the predictable variance in each group of courses could be explained by the same 4 characteristics; more favorable ratings were associated with higher prior subject interest, higher expected grades, higher levels of workload/difficulty, and a higher percentage of students taking a course for general interest. Discussion indicates that the interpretation of these effects as a bias to student ratings is unwarranted, and alternative approaches are presented.

  abstract = {Students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETEs) are weakly related\textemdash{}negatively\textemdash{}to teaching experience and age according to Feldman's (1983) comprehensive review of cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies, however, provide a weak basis for inferring the future ratings of less experienced teachers or the past ratings of more experienced teachers. Considered here are ratings of 6024 classes taught by a diverse cohort of 195 teachers representing 31 academic departments who were evaluated continuously over a 13-year period using the same multidimensional Students' Evaluations of Educational Quality instrument. For both undergraduate and graduate level courses, there were almost no changes over time for any of the nine content-specific dimensions, the overall course rating, or the overall instructor rating. The findings were consistent for teachers who had little, moderate, or substantial amounts of teaching experience at the start of the study. These results are important because this is apparently the only study to examine the stability of faculty ratings using a longitudinal design with a large and diverse group of teachers over such a long period of time.},

Previous research was used to derive higher-order models positing 1, 2, 3, and 4 higher-order factors. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of responses of SEEQ supported the 9 1st-order factors that SEEQ is designed to measure and the model with 4 2nd-order factors. For even the model with 4 higher-order factors, much of the true score variance in 1st-order factors was not explained by the higher-order factors. The study demonstrates that the SEEQ responses cannot be adequately explained by one or even a few summary scores and illustrates the application of hierarchical CFA.},

In recent years, the education community has witnessed increased interest in data-driven decision DDDM making it a mantra of educators from the central office, to the school, to the classroom. DDDM in education refers to teachers, principals, and administrators systematically collecting and analyzing various types of data, including input, process, outcome and satisfaction data, to guide a range of decisions to help improve the success of students and schools. Achievement test data, in particular, play a prominent role in federal and state accountability policies. Implicit in these policies and others is a belief that data are important sources of information to guide improvement at all levels of the education system and to hold individuals and groups accountable.

The purpose of this methodological/ substantive study is to apply a multiple-level growth modeling approach to the long-term stability of students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETs). For a diverse cohort of 195 teachers who were evaluated continuously over 13 years (6,024 classes, an average of 30.9 classes per teacher), there was little evidence that teachers became either more or less effective with added experience. This stability of SETs generalized reasonably well over undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, early career teachers, and teachers who differed substantially in terms of their teaching effectiveness overall. Whereas there were substantial individual differences between teachers in terms of their teaching effectiveness, these individual differences were also highly stable over time. Although highly supportive of the use of SETs for many purposes, the results provide a serious challenge for existing programs that assume that SET feedback alone is sufficient to improve teaching effectiveness.},

  abstract = {This article is a methodological-substantive synergy. Methodologically, we demonstrate latent-variable contextual models that integrate structural equation models (with multiple indicators) and multilevel models. These models simultaneously control for and unconfound measurement error due to sampling of items at the individual (L1) and group (L2) levels and sampling error due the sampling of persons in the aggregation of L1 characteristics to form L2 constructs. We consider a set of models that are latent or manifest in relation to sampling items (measurement error) and sampling of persons (sampling error) and discuss when different models might be most useful. We demonstrate the flexibility of these 4 core models by extending them to include random slopes, latent (single-level or cross-level) interactions, and latent quadratic effects. Substantively we use these models to test the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), showing that individual student levels of academic self-concept (L1-ASC) are positively associated with individual level achievement (L1-ACH) and negatively associated with school-average achievement (L2-ACH)\textemdash{}a finding with important policy implications for the way schools are structured. Extending tests of the BFLPE in new directions, we show that the nonlinear effects of the L1-ACH (a latent quadratic effect) and the interaction between gender and L1-ACH (an L1 \texttimes{} L1 latent interaction) are not significant. Although random-slope models show no significant school-to-school variation in relations between L1-ACH and L1-ASC, the negative effects of L2-ACH (the BFLPE) do vary somewhat with individual L1-ACH. We conclude with implications for diverse applications of the set of latent contextual models, including recommendations about their implementation, effect size estimates (and confidence intervals) appropriate to multilevel models, and directions for further research in contextual effect analysis.},

We evaluate this DUE strategy of rating overall departments and universities rather than individual teachers, and we juxtapose it with the traditional use of student ratings to evaluate individual teachers (SETs). Multilevel analyses of DUE overall ratings were not able to discriminate well between universities or departments-few universities or departments differed significantly from the grand mean. Although the a priori 5-factor structure for this DUE instrument was reasonably well-defined at the individual student level, none of the 5 factors separately or in combination discriminated well between departments or universities. In contrast to this pattern of results, we review studies showing that SETs do reliably differentiate between teachers and are valid in relation to many criteria of effective teaching. However, casual reviews of these research literatures should not use this support for SETs to justify the use of DUE-type strategies. We conclude that DUE-type ratings should be used with great caution, if at all, and should not be seen as an alternative to SETs.},

Part of the problem is undue reliance on overly restrictive CFAs in which each item loads on only one factor. Exploratory SEM (ESEM), an overarching integration of the best aspects of CFA/SEM and traditional EFA, provides confirmatory tests of a priori factor structures, relations between latent factors and multigroup/multioccasion tests of full (mean structure) measurement invariance. It incorporates all combinations of CFA factors, ESEM factors, covariates, grouping/multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) variables, latent growth, and complex structures that typically have required CFA/SEM.

  abstract = {Background: Despite increased access to student learning data, scholars have demonstrated that teachers do not always know how to use these data in ways that lead to deep changes in instruction and often lack skills and knowledge to interpret results and develop solutions. In response, administrators have invested in instructional coaches, data coaches, and professional learning communities (PLCs) to support teachers in this process. Despite their popularity, there is limited research on the ways in which coaches and PLCs mediate teachers' use of data and the various types of expertise brought to bear on this process. Purpose: This exploratory study examined how working with a coach or PLC shaped teachers' responses to data in six middle schools and the factors that influenced the activities and effects of coaches and PLCs. Our intent was to deeply examine processes and identify key constructs and relationships to guide future research and practice. Research Design: Our research involved a year-long comparative case study of six low-performing middle schools in four districts that supported teacher data use via literacy coaches, data coaches, or PLCs. We draw on cultural historical activity theory and data from 92 interviews, 6 focus groups, 20 observations of meetings, and monthly surveys of case study teachers (15), coaches (4), and PLC lead teachers (2). Findings: We found that coaches and PLCs played important roles in mediating teachers' responses to data and were often associated with instances in which teachers used data to alter their instructional delivery (as opposed to surface-level changes in materials and topics). Further, the dynamic relationship between vertical expertise (an individual's knowledge and skills) and horizontal expertise (knowledge that is co-created through interactions and movement across contexts) may help explain the ways in which PLCs and coaches facilitated deeper level changes in pedagogy. Finally, dialogue was a central mediating practice, and school leadership and the district-level context shaped the possibility for change. Teachers College Record, 117, 040308 (2015) 2 Conclusions: Our research adds conceptual clarity to what types of expertise may be needed to ensure that teachers respond productively to data. The study suggests that administrators should consider multiple facets of expertise when designing interventions, recruiting coaches, assembling PLCs, and developing professional development for coaches and teacher leaders. The centrality of dialogue also suggests the need for policies and structures allowing for uninterrupted time for educators to collectively reflect on data.},

  abstract = {Burnout is a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job, and is defined by the three dimensions of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. The past 25 years of research has established the complexity of the construct, and places the individual stress experience within a larger organizational context of people's relation to their work. Recently, the work on burnout has expanded internationally and has led to new conceptual models. The focus on engagement, the positive antithesis of burnout, promises to yield new perspectives on interventions to alleviate burnout. The social focus of burnout, the solid research basis concerning the syndrome, and its specific ties to the work domain make a distinct contribution to people's health and well-being.

After reading, students were given different tasks: (1) to write a conclusion for the text, which presented two opposing positions but lacked an overall concluding paragraph, (2) to write personal comments on the text, (3) to answer questions on conceptual understanding, and (4) to rate their interest in the text. Participants were also asked to rate their beliefs about transgenic food before and after reading the text. The findings show the effects of students' level of epistemological understanding when writing conclusions to the text, and commenting on (a) the role of science and scientists' work with respect to nature, (b) the need for further scientific investigation, and (c) the effective value of transgenic food production. Students' topic interest affected their answers to the questions on the text arguments and their text-based interest. In addition, after reading, a change emerged in students' beliefs about the topic in relation to their epistemological understanding. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The study involved 881 Italian elementary (5th grade), middle (8th grade) and high school students (11th and 13th grades). The latter attended two different branches of high school, one following a scientific, and the other a technical-commercial curriculum. Their epistemological understanding was assessed in the five judgement domains included in the instrument developed by Kuhn, Cheney, and Weinstock (2000) [Kuhn, D., Cheney, R., \& Weinstock, M. (2000). The development of epistemological understanding. Cognitive Development, 15, 309-328). Data show that more than 70\% of identified patterns were consistent and interpretable within the underlying theoretical framework. Absolutist positions were more frequent in judgments about values even when the shift to non-absolutism was attained in all other domains. Gender, grade level, and curriculum significantly differentiated participants for the first developmental transition, from absolutism to multiplism. Overall, boys showed more absolutist positions than girls, 8th graders more than 13th graders, and participants in the scientific branch more than those in the technical-commercial one. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventy 8th grade students were interviewed retrospectively after searching for online information about the scientifically controversial topic of dinosaur extinction. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Findings showed that participants expressed reflections about the simplicity/complexity, certainty/uncertainty, source, and justification of knowledge at different levels of sophistication, according to three patterns of epistemic metacognition. Prior knowledge was not related to epistemic metacognition in the search context, while study approach and epistemic beliefs about science were associated significantly, although modestly, with aspects of online knowledge evaluation. Moreover, findings revealed that Internet-based learning was influenced by overall science-related epistemic beliefs. Learning from Internet sources was also affected by study approach and epistemic reflections about the justification of online knowledge, as well as by the interaction between beliefs about the justification of scientific knowledge and beliefs about the justification of the knowledge accessed concerning the topic.},

The Special Issue starts with a theoretical paper. It is then followed by four empirical studies which deal with one or more of these questions. From all contributions it emerges that epistemic beliefs are situated within a metacognitive architecture of our mind. Moreover, all the empirical papers examine epistemic beliefs in relation to other constructs that include metacognitive aspects, mainly self-regulation in learning.

The participants (N = 64) were students of Grade 13, who were asked to think aloud during navigation. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Findings reveal that most participants spontaneously activated beliefs about all four dimensions identified in the literature, that is, about the simplicity/complexity, certainty/uncertainty, justification, and source of knowledge, at different levels of sophistication. Most epistemic reflections were about the source of knowledge.

Students in fifth (n = 213), eighth (n = 202), and eleventh (n = 281) grades completed questionnaires measuring the various constructs, and a domain knowledge test. Their grades in science were also collected. Results from structural equation modeling reveal that the hypothesized model fitted the observed data at the three grade levels, although not all expected paths were statistically significant. Students' epistemic beliefs about the development of scientific knowledge had a direct effect on domain knowledge, whereas beliefs about the justification of scientific knowledge had a direct and an indirect effect via achievement goals on knowledge acquisition. Mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals had a direct effect on self-efficacy. Knowledge had a direct and an indirect effect via self-concept on achievement.

Participants were 134 ninth graders, randomly assigned to the instruction or no-instruction condition. In both conditions the same multiple Internet sources, varying for authoritativeness and stance, were given for the basic and transfer (about GM food) inquiry tasks. Findings reveal that learners in the instruction condition outperformed the others in both the inquiry task of the instructional context and, more importantly, in the transfer inquiry task. These learners showed more appropriate navigation behavior and greater source evaluation, as well as better surface and deeper comprehension of the accessed information on GM food.

  abstract = {Abstract A fundamental hypothesis underlying research on multimedia learning is that multimedia instructional messages that are designed in light of how the human mind works are more likely to lead to meaningful learning than those that are not so designed. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning is based on three cognitive science principles of learning: the human information processing system includes dual channels for visual/pictorial and auditory/verbal processing (i.e., dual-channel assumption), each channel has a limited capacity for processing (i.e., limited-capacity assumption), and active learning entails carrying out a coordinated set of cognitive processes during learning (i.e., active processing assumption). The cognitive theory of multimedia learning specifies five cognitive processes in multimedia learning: selecting relevant words from the presented text or narration, selecting relevant images from the presented graphics, organizing the selected words into a coherent verbal representation, organizing selected images into a coherent pictorial representation, and integrating the pictorial and verbal representations and prior knowledge. Three demands on the learner's cognitive capacity during learning are extraneous processing (which is not related to the instructional objective), essential processing (which is needed to mentally represent the essential material as presented), and generative processing (which is aimed at making sense of the material). Three instructional goals are to reduce extraneous processing (for extraneous overload situations), manage essential processing (for essential overload situations), and foster generative processing (for generative underuse situations). Multimedia instructional messages should be designed to guide appropriate cognitive processing during learning without overloading the learner's cognitive system.},

One hundred and fifty university students read an expert discussion on the topic of computer use in childhood. Information was presented in either a one-sided (each expert holds one position: pro or contra) or two-sided way (both experts provide pro and contra arguments). Results showed that readers judged experts who communicated more consensus-oriented by taking a two-sided stance to be more trustworthy. Additionally, readers in this group subsequently outlined their own opinion toward the topic more confidently. However, the manipulation did not influence how far readers drew on expert information when formulating a response to a writing task. Implications are drawn for helping readers to process expert discussions and for improving expert communication strategies.

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

In the quantitative phase, we conducted an experiment in which high school students (n= 45) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions and received their respective pre-reading task instructions. Quantitative analyses showed that task instructions affected topic beliefs and belief justifications. However, inspection of topic belief scores within each condition indicated that some individuals' beliefs became weaker, whereas others' became stronger. In the qualitative phase, we conducted interviews to explain why this occurred. The interview data revealed two distinct reader profiles: belief-reflection and belief-protection.

The experts agreed over 94\% of the time on assignment of items to objectives and 98\% on the scoring of items. TOGS was first administered to 119 7th, 9th, and 1 lth graders. The reliability (KR-20) was 0.81. Poorly functioning items were rewritten based on the item difficulty and discrimination data. The revised version of the test was given to 377 7th through 12th grade students. Total scores ranged from 2 to 26 correct (X= 13.3, S.D. =5.3). The reliability (KR- 20) was 0.83 for all subjects and ranged from 0.71 for eighth graders to 0.88 for ni?th graders.

However, the emphasis placed on null hypothesis significance testing in academic training and reporting may lead researchers to interpret evidence dichotomously rather than continuously.

Surveys of researchers across a wide variety of fields (including medicine, epidemiology, cognitive science, psychology, business, and economics) show that a substantial majority does indeed do so. This phenomenon is manifest both in researchers' interpretations of descriptions of evidence and in their likelihood judgments.

  abstract = {Recent reports show that fewer adolescents believe that regular cannabis use is harmful to health. Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline. Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain and highlight the importance of prevention and policy efforts targeting adolescents.},

  abstract = {In-service and preservice teachers are increasingly required to integrate research results into their classroom practice. However, due to their limited methodological background knowledge, they often cannot evaluate scientific evidence firsthand and instead must trust the sources on which they rely. In two experimental studies, we investigated the amount of this so-called epistemic trustworthiness (dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence) that student-teachers ascribe to the authors of texts who present classical research findings (e.g., learning with worked-out examples) that allegedly were written by a practitioner, an expert, or a scientist. Results from the first exploratory study suggest that student-teachers view scientists as ``smart but evil,'' since they rate them as having substantially more expertise than practitioners, while also being less benevolent and lacking in integrity. Moreover, results from the exploratory study suggest that evaluativistic epistemic beliefs (beliefs about the nature of knowledge) predict epistemic trustworthiness. A preregistered conceptual replication study (Study 2) provided more evidence for the ``smart but evil'' stereotype. Further directions of research as well as implications for practice are discussed.},

Such data are usually not provided in raw form, instead graphs are presented which encode transformed and aggregated data. Such graphs generally allow an effective extraction of the relevant information but simultaneously challenge teachers' statistical literacy. The present study investigates this trade-off by design-based-research with private tutors. We triangulated perceived informativity and validity of interpretation (N = 83) about differently aggregated and encoded feedback on instructional quality (N = 9730) with log files from a feedback web application (N = 232). We found associations between dwelling time (on specific graphics) and the corresponding perceived informativity (positive, monotonous, quadratic) and perceived validity of interpretation (U-shaped, quadratic). Additionally there was evidence for a preference of very simple statistical coefficients and transformations (arithmetic mean, likert scale). The relevance of these results was discussed on the background of the present highly mathematicsoriented sample.},

  abstract = {The traditional conception of validity divides it into three separate and substitutable types: content, criterion, and construct validities. This view is fragmented and incomplete, especially because it fails to take into account both evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. The new unified concept of validity interrelates these issues as fundamental aspects of a more comprehensive theory of construct validity that addresses both score meaning and social values in test interpretation and test use. That is, unified validity integrates considerations of content, criteria, and consequences into a construct framework for the empirical testing of rational hypotheses about score meaning and theoretically relevant relationships, including those of an applied and a scientific nature. Six distinguishable aspects of construct validity are highlighted as a means of addressing central issues implicit in the notion of validity as a unified concept. These are content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external, and consequential aspects of construct validity. In effect, these six aspects function as general validity criteria or standards for all educational and psychological measurement, including performance assessments, which are discussed in some detail because of their increasing emphasis in educational and employment settings.

  abstract = {Recently, there has been growing scientific interest for cross-national survey research. Various scholars have used multilevel techniques to link individual characteristics to aspects of the na-tional context. At first sight, multilevel SEM seems to be a promising tool for this purpose, as it integrates multilevel modeling within a latent variable framework. However, due to the fact that the number of countries in most international surveys does not exceed 30, the application of multilevel SEM in cross-national research is problematic. Taking European Social Survey (ESS) data as a point of departure, this paper uses Monte Carlo studies to assess the estimation accuracy of multilevel SEM with small group sample sizes. The results indicate that a group sample size of 20 \textendash{} a situation common in cross-national research \textendash{} does not guarantee accurate estimation at all. Unacceptable amounts of parameter and stan-dard error bias are present for the between-level estimates. Unless the standardized effect is very large (0.75), statistical power for detecting a significant between-level structural effect is seriously lacking. Required group sample sizes depend strongly on the specific interests of the researcher, the expected effect sizes and the complexity of the model. If the between-level model is relatively simple and one is merely interested in the between-level factor structure, a group sample size of 40 could be sufficient. To detect large ({$>$}0.50) structural effects at the between level, at least 60 groups are required. To have an acceptable probability of detecting smaller effects, more than 100 groups are needed. These guidelines are shown to be quite robust for varying cluster sizes and intra-class correlations (ICCs).},

Data-driven decision making (DDDM) has become an emerging field of practice for school leadership and a central focus of education policy and practice. Purpose: This study examined principals' DDDM practices and identified the factors influencing DDDM using the theoretical frame of information use environments. Participants: Participants were 183 public high school principals in a Midwestern state. Research Design: The research design was cross-sectional survey research. Data Collection and Analysis: Survey instruments were developed and administered to principals. Structural equation modeling was conducted to determine what factors significantly affect principals' DDDM practices in different leadership dimensions. Findings: Principals used data more frequently in instructional and organization operational leadership than in the leadership dimensions of school vision and collaborative partnerships. Different contextual factors affected data use in different leadership dimensions. Human-related factors such as perceptions of data quality and data analysis skills seemed to have direct effects on data use in addressing administrative problems in instruction and organizational operation, in which data were used frequently. Organization-related factors such as school district requirement and accessibility of data tended to have more direct influence on data use in the leadership dimensions of school vision and collaborative partnerships, where data were used less often. Conclusions: This study supports the proposition that as information behavior, DDDM is situational, multidimensional, and dynamic. Results provide insights into practice, research, and theoretical foundation for the emerging topic of DDDM. \textcopyright{} 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration.},

When some values of the covariates are missing, analysts can use multiple imputation to fill in the missing data, estimate propensity scores based on the m completed datasets, and use the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects. We compare two approaches to implement this process. In the first, the analyst estimates the treatment effect using propensity score matching within each completed data set, and averages the m treatment effect estimates. In the second approach, the analyst averages the m propensity scores for each record across the completed datasets, and performs propensity score matching with these averaged scores to estimate the treatment effect. We compare properties of both methods via simulation studies using artificial and real data. The simulations suggest that the second method has greater potential to produce substantial bias reductions than the first, particularly when the missing values are predictive of treatment assignment.},

However, this risk is highly stratified by sex: Same-sex attraction is associated with 95\% higher odds of discipline among girls but no apparent discipline risk among boys. Sexual minority girls' risk for discipline is only partially mediated by behavior, a result that is plausibly consistent with the interpretation that these students continue to face discriminatory treatment in schools.},

Data were inductively gathered from ten teachers' and five students' use experiences of \{FWBLRs\} in the context of a smart school in Tehran, Iran. Focus groups and face-to-face semi-structured interviews, repeated in several rounds, were used for data collection. Thematic analysis elaborate on the teachers' perceived pedagogical usability of FWBLRs. Five main motivations of pedagogical usability emerged from the findings: (a) desirability; (b) content accessibility; (c) student-centred teaching support; (d) multimedia interactivity; and (e) feasible classroom instruction via simulation. The study suggests that the effective use of Web-based Learning Resources (WBLRs) would require some considerations, including the use context and corresponding educational policies. This can be of value to the researchers in the field as well as stakeholders of WBLRs. In practice, this can support the development of effective and fun teaching\textendash{}learning environments.},

  abstract = {Solar energy has become an important renewable energy source for reducing the use of fossil fuels and to mitigate global warming, for which solar collectors constitute a technology that is to be promoted. The use of nanofluids can increase the efficiency of solar into thermal energy conversion in solar collectors. Experimental values for the specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity of alumina/water nanofluids are needed to evaluate the influence of the solid content (from 0.25 to 5 v\%) and the flow rate on the Reynolds, Nusselt and the heat transfer coefficient. In the laminar flow regime, thermal conductivity enhancement over specific heat decrement is key parameter, and a 2.34\% increase in the heat transfer coefficient is theoretically obtained for 1 v\% alumina nanofluid. To corroborate the results, experimental tests were run in a flat plate solar collector. A reduction in efficiency from 47\% to 41.5\% and a decrease in the heat removal factor were obtained using the nanofluid due to the formation of a nanoparticle deposition layer adding an addition thermal resistance to heat transfer. Nanofluids are recommended only if the nanoparticle concentration is high enough to enhance thermal conductivity, but no so high so as to avoid wall deposition.},

Although most theorists attribute these perceptions to the beliefs of religious targets, religious individuals also differ in behavioral ways that might cue trust. We examined whether perceivers might trust religious targets more because they heuristically associate religion with slow life-history strategies. In three experiments, we found that religious targets are viewed as slow life-history strategists and that these findings are not the result of a universally positive halo effect; that the effect of target religion on trust is significantly mediated by the target's life-history traits (i.e., perceived reproductive strategy); and that when perceivers have direct information about a target's reproductive strategy, their ratings of trust are driven primarily by his or her reproductive strategy, rather than religion. These effects operate over and above targets' belief in moralizing gods and offer a novel theoretical perspective on religion and ...},

With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.},

The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges that arise when knowledge production occurs in cross-disciplinary settings. To date most studies on communities of practice have focused on knowledge production within communities of practice rather than across communities of practice. We analyse the various professional groups in a medical R\{\&\}D department as a constellation of distinct, but interconnected communities of practice with different epistemic cultures. The medical R\{\&\}D case is particularly interesting for this purpose, because it involved creating new cross-disciplinary practices between different pre-existing and well-established communities of practice. In line with our focus on the challenges and processes involved in cross-disciplinary knowledge production, we describe negotiations and tensions during the establishment of the department, as well as in day-to-day practice. In particular, we focus on how the 'machineries of knowledge production', that is, the actual mechanisms by which knowledge is pursued, are different across the various communities of practice. These machineries belong to different epistemic cultures on a national or even international scale, and thus every community of practice is part of a complex web of people, activities and material structures extending well beyond the immediate work context. This networked character of knowing in practice explain why learning on the system level of communities of practice can be challenging. It may lead to path-dependent learning processes, and radical change can become limited if the knowledge required by new and different practices is incompatible with the existing stock of knowledge. Consequently, we suggest that the communities of practice approach could be enriched by looking at diversity and discontinuity in the epistemic cultures and networks that the different communities of practice are associated with.

Studies examining beliefs about mathematics revealed consistent patterns of nonavailing beliefs at all educational levels. Mathematics instructional environments were inferred to influence the development of beliefs about mathematics. All studies revealed significant relationships between beliefs and cognition, motivation, and academic achievement. Descriptive studies found relationships between beliefs and learning behaviors. Studies examining domain differences found significant variations in beliefs across disciplines. Studies focusing on changing beliefs were successful, which was attributed to appropriate changes in instructional style. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.},

  year = {2005},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines relations between personal epistemology and facets of self-regulated learning, moves away from correlational designs, and adopts a more process-oriented methodology. For this study, a philosophical conceptualization of epistemology was integrated with conceptualizations from educational psychology and mathematics education. The primary purpose of this study was to examine relations between approaches to knowing, mathematics problem solving, and regulation of cognition. A secondary purpose was to examine whether mathematics students become more rational in their approaches to knowing and whether their epistemic beliefs change through higher levels of education. One hundred twenty-seven students were sampled from undergraduate university mathematics and statistics courses. Students completed self-report measures to reflect epistemic styles, epistemic beliefs, and dispositions regarding elements of self-regulated learning. Students were profiled as predominantly rational, predominantly empirical, or both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing. Seventeen students were chosen to participate in two problem-solving sessions. Problem-solving episodes were coded for evidence of planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. Differences in self-reported metacognitive self-regulation were found between students profiled as high on rationalism and empiricism and students profiled as predominantly empirical. No other self-reported differences were found. When problem solving, students profiled as predominantly rational had the highest frequency of planning, monitoring, and control. These differences were attributed to patterns identified in students' self-efficacy. No differences in rationalism scores were found between lower- and upper-year university students but differences were found in their beliefs about the structure of knowledge and the source of knowledge. Differences were also found in the quality of rational arguments between lower- and upper-year university students when solving problems. Students profiled as predominantly rational in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problems solving. Similarly, students profiled as predominantly empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly empirical in their approaches to problem solving. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing were predominantly rational in their approaches to problem solving. Results are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Two hundred one undergraduate students from an educational psychology course completed questionnaires designed to measure the various constructs. Students' final grades were also collected at the end of the semester. Students' recollections of course tasks revealed that their epistemic beliefs are activated during learning. Results from structural equation modeling revealed epistemic beliefs influenced the types of achievement goals students adopted, which subsequently influenced the types of learning strategies they used in their education course, and their achievement. Moreover, achievement goals mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, and learning strategies mediated relations between achievement goals and achievement.

Two hundred thirty-one university students completed self-report inventories reflecting their epistemic profiles and use of metacognitive strategies, and were epistemically profiled as rational, empirical, or both rational and empirical in their approaches to knowing. From the larger sample, 78 students participated in a problem-solving session using a think aloud protocol. Results demonstrated that for self-reported metacognitive strategies, students profiled as both rational and empirical had the highest frequency of metacognitive strategy use compared to students profiled as empirical. Similarly, during problem solving, students profiled as both rational and empirical had the highest frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as empirical or rational. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical attained higher levels of problem-solving achievement compared to students profiled as empirical.

Eighty-three university undergraduate students completed questionnaires designed to measure their epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge about Newtonian physics. Students were epistemically profiled as rational, empirical, or metaphorical in their approaches to knowing. Using a think-aloud protocol, students read a text on Newton's First and Third Laws. The text included metaphors as examples of the various laws described. Results revealed that students profiled as metaphorical engaged in more metacognitive processing compared to students profiled as rational or empirical. Moreover, path analyses revealed that metacognitive monitoring positively predicted recall performance. Results challenge Muis' (2008) consistency hypothesis; the ways in which knowledge is represented in text may be the linking factor for relations between metacognitive monitoring and epistemic beliefs rather than the underlying epistemology of the domain.

The intervention was based on constructivist teaching practices that incorporated teacher modeling of critical thinking of content, evaluation of multiple approaches to solving problems, and making connections to prior knowledge. Sixty-three students across 2 classrooms (one intervention [n = 31], one control [n = 32]) participated and completed questionnaires 5 times over the semester. Questionnaires measured students' epistemic beliefs, learning strategies, and levels of motivation for their statistics class. Results revealed that for students in the intervention class, their epistemic beliefs shifted midway through the semester, whereas students in the control group maintained a consistent level of beliefs throughout the semester. Intervention students' self-reported use of critical thinking and elaboration strategies also significantly increased midway through the semester, as did their levels of self-efficacy for learning statistics. In contrast, students in the control group maintained a consistent level of strategy use and self-efficacy. Finally, students in the intervention group had a significantly higher final grade compared with those in the control group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Students completed a conceptually oriented test and a procedurally oriented test on the same content 1 week apart, and they immediately responded to the Epistemological Beliefs Assessment for Physical Science questionnaire after completion of each test. Results revealed that girls espoused more constructivist beliefs about physics for conceptual knowledge than for procedural knowledge, whereas the opposite was found for boys. Moreover, female students espoused more constructivist beliefs than did male students across both types. These results have important theoretical and methodological implications.

  abstract = {There has been a tremendous methodological development of Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the social and behavioral sciences, and related fields. This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R-package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools (i) for Bayesian exploratory testing (null vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) for Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) for common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.},

Diese sind f{\"u}r Lehr-Lernprozesse von besonderer Relevanz, da sie handlungsleitende und handlungssteuernde Funktionen besitzen. So belegen empirische Studien Zusammenh{\"a}nge zwischen den epistemologischen {\"U}berzeugungen von Lernenden und Lernstrategien, Probleml{\"o}sef{\"a}higkeit, Ausdauer beim Lernen, Interesse, Textverstehen und Lernerfolg. Dieser gro{\ss}en Bedeutung der epistemologischen {\"U}berzeugungen und zahlreichen empirischen Studien stehen zwei bedeutende Forschungsdefizite gegen{\"u}ber. Insbesondere hinsichtlich der Konzeptualisierung und der Methodologie lassen sich Defizite identifizieren, die in empirischen Studien fokussiert werden m{\"u}ssen, um zu ihrer Kl{\"a}rung beizutragen. Mit der vorliegenden Publikation werden daher zwei Fragestellungen in den Blick genommen, die an diesen Forschungsdesiderata ansetzen: 1. Wie viele (Quantit{\"a}t) und welche (Qualit{\"a}t) Dimensionen geh{\"o}ren zum Konstrukt der epistemologischen {\"U}berzeugungen? 2. Welches Instrument ist geeignet, epistemologische {\"U}berzeugungen zu erfassen? Hierzu f{\"u}hrt die Autorin eine theoriegeleitete Analyse des Konstrukts der epistemologischen {\"U}berzeugungen durch, die durch empirische Ergebnisse erg{\"a}nzt wird. Ausgehend von einer mehrdimensionalen Modellvorstellung epistemologischer {\"U}berzeugungen werden 161 Handelslehramtsstudierende mittels Fragebogen und Netzinterview befragt. Die quantitativen und qualitativen Ergebnisse werden im Sinne der Triangulation aufeinander bezogen und in einem Referenzmodell zusammengef{\"u}hrt. Das Resultat ist vielversprechend: Es konnten mit Hilfe des Methoden-Mix sechs Dimensionen epistemologischer {\"U}berzeugungen repliziert werden. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus wurden Hinweise auf weitere Randdimensionen und Aspekte des Konstrukts gewonnen.\{\textbackslash{}dq\} (Autorenreferat).},

The statistical analysis technology available for such data is, however, limited in scope. This study investigates and further develops statistical methods that could be used in software for the analysis of data collected under complex sample designs. First, it identifies sev- eral recent methodological lines of inquiry which taken to- gether provide a powerful and general statistical basis for a complex sample, structural equation modeling analysis. Sec- ond, it extends some of this research to new situations of in- terest. A Monte Carlo study that empirically evaluates these techniques on simulated data comparable to those in large- scale complex surveys demonstrates that they work well in prac- tice. Due to the generality of the approaches, the methods cover not only continuous normal variables but also continuous non- normal variables and dichotomous variables. Two methods de- signed to take into account the complex sample structure were Muthen's investigated in the Monte Carlo study. One method, termed aggregated analysis, computes the usual parameter estimates but adjusts standard errors and goodness-of-fit model testing. The other method, termed disaggregated analysis, includes a new set of parameters reflecting the complex sample structure. Both of the methods worked very well. The conventional method that ignores complex sampling worked poorly, support- ing the need for development of special methods for complex survey data.},

The researcher will learn how to use the Facets (Linacre, 2001) computer program to study five effects: leniency/severity, central tendency, randomness, halo, and differential leniency/severity. Part 1 of the paper provides critical background and context for studying MFRM. We present a catalog of rater effects, introducing effects that researchers have studied over the last three-quarters of a century in order to help readers gain a historical perspective on how those effects have been conceptualized. The second half of Part 1 provides conceptual and mathematical explanations of many-facet Rasch measurement, focusing on how researchers can use MFRM to study rater effects. First, we present the many-facet version of Andrich's (1978) rating scale model and identify questions about a rating operation that researchers can address using this model. We then introduce three hybrid MFRM models, explain the conceptual distinctions among them, describe how they differ from the rating scale model, and identify questions about a rating operation that researchers can address using these hybrid models.

Motivational processes were studied from a within-person perspective, with expectancies and values being assessed or experimentally manipulated across multiple domains and the focus being placed on intraindividual differences. In contrast, contemporary expectancy-value models in educational psychology concentrate almost exclusively on linear effects of expectancy and value on motivational outcomes, with a focus on between-person differences. Recent advances in latent variable methodology allow both issues to be addressed in observational studies. Using the expectancy-value model of homework motivation as a theoretical framework, this study estimated multilevel structural equation models with latent interactions in a sample of 511 secondary school students and found synergistic effects between domain-specific homework expectancy and homework value in predicting homework engagement in 6 subjects. This approach not only brings the "x" back into expectancy-value theory but also reestablishes the within-person perspective as the appropriate level of analysis for latent expectancy-value models.

Wanous et al (1997) by investigating the use of a single-term approach measuring facet satisfaction. 207 employees (aged 19-60 yrs) from a variety of organizations completed a job satisfaction survey containing Job Descriptive Index (JDI) as well as a single-item which also measured each of 5 JDI facets. The results indicate that the single-item facet measure was significantly correlated with each of the JDI facets. Results also indicated that the single-item approach compared favorably to the JDI and in some cases accounted for incremental variance in self-reported job performance and intentions to turnover. Implications include the notions that single-item measures may be easier and take less time to complete, may be less expensive, may contain more face validity, and may be more flexible than multiple-item scales measuring facet satisfaction.

  abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of `variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

This sparked a period of methodological reflection that we review here and call Psychology's Renaissance. We begin by describing how psychologists' concerns with publication bias shifted from worrying about file-drawered studies to worrying about p-hacked analyses. We then review the methodological changes that psychologists have proposed and, in some cases, embraced. In describing how the renaissance has unfolded, we attempt to describe different points of view fairly but not neutrally, so as to identify the most promising paths forward. In so doing, we champion disclosure and preregistration, express skepticism about most statistical solutions to publication bias, take positions on the analysis and interpretation of replication failures, and contend that meta-analytical thinking increases the prevalence of false positives. Our general thesis is that the scientific practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically.},

In this study, theoretical assumptions about domain-specific determinants of interest and performances in second language acquisition are tested, using data from a sample of 1 655 eighth graders in three Swiss cantons: Fribourg, Lucerne, and Valais. Factor analysis yielded five factors related to teaching dimensions of French as an additional language: use of French in lessons, intensity of language use and practice, use of authentic material, vocabulary learning, and communication with native speakers. Subsequent multilevel analyses showed that using French in lessons, as well as intensive language use and practice are significantly associated with the students performances and the interest the develop over a 1-year period. Vocabulary learning has no effect. Contrary to expectations, there is a negative relationship between communicating with French native speakers and the development of interest for learning French as a second language. (DIPF/Orig.)},

Mittels anschliessender Mehrebenenanalysen konnte gezeigt werden, dass der Gebrauch des Franz{\"o}sischen und intensives {\"U}ben/Anwenden statistisch signifikant mit einer g{\"u}nstigen Entwicklung von Leistung und des Interesses im Verlaufe eines Jahres assoziiert waren. Ohne Einfluss blieb das Lernen von Vokabeln. Erwartungswidrig fand sich ein negativer Zusammenhang zwischen der Kommunikation mit Fremdsprachigen und der Entwicklung von Interesse an der betreffenden Sprache. (DIPF/Orig.) Research on the quality of second language teaching has recently highlighted the need to consider not only cross-curricular but also domain-specific dimensions of instructional quality. In this study, theoretical assumptions about domain-specific determinants of interest and performances in second language acquisition are tested, using data from a sample of 1 655 eighth graders in three Swiss cantons: Fribourg, Lucerne, and Valais. Factor analysis yielded five factors related to teaching dimensions of French as an additional language: use of French in lessons, intensity of language use and practice, use of authentic material, vocabulary learning, and communication with native speakers. Subsequent multilevel analyses showed that using French in lessons, as well as intensive language use and practice are significantly associated with the students performances and the interest the develop over a 1-year period. Vocabulary learning has no effect. Contrary to expectations, there is a negative relationship between communicating with French native speakers and the development of interest for learning French as a second language. (DIPF/Orig.)},

  abstract = {The article provides a theoretical extension of the goal orientation approach for teaching by proposing three different competence facets of learning goals and four types of addressees for performance approach and avoidance goals. On the basis of responses from 495 teacher trainees and 224 in-service teachers, the development and validation of an advanced goal orientation measure is presented. Internal consistencies of the goal dimensions were good, and confirmatory factor analyses verified the postulated model for teacher trainees and in-service teachers. In both groups, learning goal orientation positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and perceived benefits of help-seeking. Performance approach goals positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and performance avoidance goals negatively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and positively predicted perceived threats of help-seeking. The use of goal orientation facets provided a more thorough analysis of the predictions regarding perceptions of help-seeking. Results supported the convergent and divergent validity of the new measure. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We outline a path that moves away from the existing model of scientific communication to improve the efficiency in meeting the purpose of public science - knowledge accumulation. We call for six changes: (1) full embrace of digital communication, (2) open access to all published research, (3) disentangling publication from evaluation, (4) breaking the "one article, one journal" model with a grading system for evaluation and diversified dissemination outlets, (5) publishing peer review, and, (6) allowing open, continuous peer review. We address conceptual and practical barriers to change, and provide examples showing how the suggested practices are being used already. The critical barriers to change are not technical or financial; they are social. While scientists guard the status quo, they also have the power to change it.},

Data suggest that the students enrolled in the training program, comparing with students in the control group, showed a significant improvement in their declarative knowledge, general and on text use of learning strategies, increased their deep approach to learning, decreased their use of a surface approach and, in what concerns to academic achievement, statistically significant differences have been found in favour of the experimental group.},

  abstract = {The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most widely used declarative language for accessing relational databases, and an essential topic in introductory database courses in higher learning institutions. Despite the intuitiveness of SQL, formulating and comprehending written queries can be confusing, especially for undergraduate students. One major reason for this is that the simple syntax of SQL is often misleading and hard to comprehend. A number of tools have been developed to aid the comprehension of queries and to improve the mental models of students concerning the underlying logic of SQL. Some of these tools employed visualisation and animation in their approach to aid the comprehension of SQL. This paper presents an interactive comprehension aid based on visualisation, specifically designed to support the SQL SELECT statement, an area identified in the literature as problematic for students. The visualisation tool uses visual specifications depicting SQL operations to build queries. This is expected to reduce the cognitive load of a student who is learning SQL. We have shown with an online survey that adopting visual specifications in teaching systems assist students in attaining a richer learning experience in introductory database courses.},

LCA and LPA are useful when you want to reduce a large number of continuous (LPA) or categorical (LCA) variables to a few subgroups. They can also help experimenters in situations where the treatment effect is different for different people, but we do not know which people. This chapter explains how LPA and LCA work, what assumptions are behind the techniques, and how you can use R to apply them.},

  abstract = {The habitual "any other comments" general open question at the end of structured questionnaires has the potential to increase response rates, elaborate responses to closed questions, and allow respondents to identify new issues not captured in the closed questions. However, we believe that many researchers have collected such data and failed to analyse or present it. General open questions at the end of structured questionnaires can present a problem because of their uncomfortable status of being strictly neither qualitative nor quantitative data, the consequent lack of clarity around how to analyse and report them, and the time and expertise needed to do so. We suggest that the value of these questions can be optimised if researchers start with a clear understanding of the type of data they wish to generate from such a question, and employ an appropriate strategy when designing the study. The intention can be to generate depth data or 'stories' from purposively defined groups of respondents for qualitative analysis, or to produce quantifiable data, representative of the population sampled, as a 'safety net' to identify issues which might complement the closed questions. We encourage researchers to consider developing a more strategic use of general open questions at the end of structured questionnaires. This may optimise the quality of the data and the analysis, reduce dilemmas regarding whether and how to analyse such data, and result in a more ethical approach to making best use of the data which respondents kindly provide.},

  abstract = {Graphs facilitate the communication of important quantitative information, often serving as effective decision support tools. Yet, graphs are not equally useful for all individuals, as people differ substantially in their graph literacy\textemdash{}the ability to understand graphically presented information. Although some features of graphs can be interpreted using spatial-to-conceptual mappings that can be established by adults and children with no graphing experience (e.g., ``higher bars equal larger quantities''), other features are linked to arbitrary graph conventions (e.g., axes labels and scales). In two experiments, we examined differences in the processes underlying the comprehension of graphs presenting medical information in individuals with low and high graph literacy. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they interpreted graphs in which information in conventional features was incongruent with that conveyed by spatial features. Results revealed that participants with low graph literacy more often relied on misleading spatial-to-conceptual mappings and misinterpreted the data depicted. Higher graph literacy was often associated with more time spent viewing the conventional features containing essential information for accurate interpretations. This suggests that individuals with high graph literacy are better able to identify the task-relevant information in graphs, and thus attend to the relevant features to a larger extent. Theoretical, methodological, and prescriptive implications for customization of decision-support systems are discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To answer these questions, we interviewed all 3rd- and 5th-grade teachers in five average- and above-average-performing elementary schools three times during the 2006\textendash{}07 school year. We found that although the teachers in our study used interim assessment results to gain information about students' learning in mathematics, teachers did not use interim assessments to make sense of students' conceptual understanding.

Drawing upon semiotic theory, we examine explicit thematic patterns (semantic meaning relations among science concepts) as well as hidden social, nature of science (NOS), and epistemological meanings co-constructed and communicated by teachers and students. It was found that a kindergarten teacher's discussion was mostly unhedged and boosted (absolutely), with the use of hedges (may, might, could) limited to an unexpected encounter with an undeveloped egg toward the end of the lesson. In contrast, a fourth-grade teacher's discussion was predominantly hedged, with the use of boosters limited to isolated episodes concerning the nature of scientific inquiry and experimental variables. Unhedged and boosted communication led to the co-construction of an unproblematic or factual body of scientific knowledge (transitivity, circumstantial, and nominal meanings), whereas hedged communication produced a problematic or tentative body of scientific knowledge (logical and taxonomic meanings). It is emphasized that unproblematic knowledge communication may be paralleled by NOS miscommunication. We argue that teachers should be provided with professional development that can increase their awareness of the risk of NOS miscommunication. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Should job applicants be assessed on fine-grained personality variables or on broader personality variables, such as the Big Five dimensions of personality? Most human resources practitioners and researchers appear to assume that more specific and narrow measures of personality traits result in better and more fine-grained understanding of the person, and therefore ought to be preferred over global measures. We review evidence that when the criterion of interest is job performance, broader personality measures may be preferable over narrowly focused ones. It appears that the alleged advantages of narrowly defined traits and narrowly constructed measures are mainly due to erroneous conventional beliefs predicated upon statistical artifacts. In personnel selection research and practice, we advocate the use of broader personality traits for both better prediction and explanation.},

  volume = {349},
  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

Especially, the lack of consensus on the context-general and/or context-specific nature of epistemological beliefs deserves our attention. We argue that research in the field today is mainly characterized by a top-down approach that investigates students' domain-specific beliefs from a general epistemological perspective. Alternatively, we report on one of our studies as well as some other research that takes a bottom-up approach starting from students' domain-specific belief systems and analyzing their epistemic dimensions. Results of these studies point to the highly domain-specific nature of students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing. Therefore, a conceptual distinction between students' general epistemological beliefs and the epistemic dimensions of domain-related belief systems is recommended as a more appropriate way to address the context-general-context-specific discussion on epistemological beliefs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In Study 1, the two tests were translated and applied to a Spanish-speaking sample. A detailed dimensionality exploration, by means of the monotone homogeneity model and confirmatory factor analysis, provides unexpected dimensionality results. Therefore, a new test is proposed, and the dimensionality and psychometric properties of the test's scores are determined. The new test retains four of the five original dimensions. The EQEBI has 27 items, and its score reliability is higher than that of the original EQ and EBI. In Study 2, the EQEBI was applied to another sample to verify the psychometric properties of the obtained scores. The expected four unidimensional scales are confirmed. The scales are calibrated with the graded response model. Recommendations are offered for using the scales for epistemological beliefs assessment.

Strongly gender-identified women showed significantly greater liking for feminine occupations in the stereotype-activation condition than in the control condition. However, more weakly identified women did not show the same effect. In contrast, women weak in gender identification reported an increase in perceived ability for feminine occupations when stereotypes were activated than in the control condition. Activating gender stereotypes did not shift reported liking or perceived ability in traditionally masculine occupations. These results demonstrate the theoretical and practical importance of gender stereotypes on women's career-related attitudes.},

  abstract = {Background. Quantitative risk information plays an important role in decision making about health. This study focuses on commonly used numerical and graphical formats and examines their effect on perception of differ-ent likelihoods and choice preferences. Methods. An experimental study was conducted with 192 participants, who evaluated 2 sets of 4 lotteries. Numerical formats to describe likelihood varied systematically between partici-pants (X\%, X-in-100, or 1-in-X). The effect of graphic for-mats (bar charts, icon charts) was assessed as a within-subjects factor. Dependent measures included perceived likelihood, choice preferences about participating in the lottery, and processing times. Results. Numerical likeli-hoods presented as 1-in-X were processed fastest and were perceived as conveying larger likelihoods than the X-in-100 and percentages formats (mean response times in seconds: 5.65 v. 7.31 and 6.50; mean rating on a 1\textendash{}9 scale: 4.38 v. 3.30 and 3.31, respectively). The 1-in-X for-mat also evoked a stronger willingness to participate in a lottery than the 2 other numerical formats. The effect of adding graphs on perceived likelihood was moderated by numerical aptitude. Graphs reduced ratings of per-ceived likelihood of participants with lower numeracy, while there was no overall effect for participants with higher numeracy. Conclusion. Perception of likelihood differs significantly depending on the numerical format used. The 1-in-X format yields higher perceived likeli-hoods and it appears to be the easiest format to interpret. Graphs primarily affect perception of likelihood of people with lower numerical aptitude. These effects should be taken into account when discussing medical risks with pa-tients.},

Constructivist Learning Environment Survey, Scientific Epistemological Beliefs, and Learning Approach Questionnaire were administered to 1152 Turkish eight grade elementary school students to measure constructivist learning environment perceptions, scientific epistemological beliefs, and learning approach, respectively. Path analysis supported the model in general, although not all proposed paths were significant. All constructivist learning environment perception variables were found to predict learning approach directly and indirectly through tentative beliefs. The relationship between fixed beliefs and learning approach was not significant. Fixed beliefs were significantly related only with personal relevance variable.

CLT is concerned with the design of instructional methods that efficiently use people's limited cognitive processing capacity to apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations (i.e., transfer). CLT is based on a cognitive architecture that consists of a limited working memory with partly independent processing units for visual and auditory information, which interacts with an unlimited long-term memory. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel efficient instructional methods. The associated research has shown that measures of cognitive load can reveal important information for CLT that is not necessarily reflected by traditional performance-based measures. Particularly, the combination of performance and cognitive load measures has been identified to constitute a reliable estimate of the mental efficiency of instructional methods. The discussion of previously used cognitive load measurement techniques and their role in the advancement of CLT is followed by a discussion of aspects of CLT that may benefit by measurement of cognitive load.

  abstract = {1. Plant growth is a fundamental ecological process, integrating across scales from physiology to community dynamics and ecosystem properties. Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant\textendash{}herbivore interactions and ecosystem function- ing. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume thatRGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates,which allowunbiased compari- sons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensiveworked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinearmodels coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology.For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates.Wehope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuademore ecologists to use these techniques.},

  abstract = {Submissions to an online homework tutor were analyzed to determine whether they were copied. The fraction of copied submissions increased rapidly over the semester, as each weekly deadline approached and for problems later in each assignment. The majority of students, who copied less than 10\% of their problems, worked steadily over the three days prior to the deadline, whereas repetitive copiers those who copied 30\% of their submitted problems exerted little effort early. Importantly, copying homework problems that require an analytic answer correlates with a 2 decline over the semester in relative score for similar problems on exams but does not significantly correlate with the amount of conceptual learning as measured by pretesting and post-testing. An anonymous survey containing questions used in many previous studies of self-reported academic dishonesty showed 1/3 less copying than actually was detected. The observed patterns of copying, free response questions on the survey, and interview data suggest that time pressure on students who do not start their homework in a timely fashion is the proximate cause of copying. Several measures of initial ability in math or physics correlated with copying weakly or not at all. Changes in course format and instructional practices that previous self-reported academic dishonesty surveys and/or the observed copying patterns sug- gested would reduce copying have been accompanied by more than a factor of 4 reduction of copying from 11\% of all electronic problems to less than 3\%. As expected since repetitive copiers have approximately three times the chance of failing, this was accompanied by a reduction in the overall course failure rate. Survey results indicate that students copy almost twice as much written homework as online homework and show that students nationally admit to more academic dishonesty than MIT students.},

This article provides an overview of the current state and problems of feedback for teachers and students in primary schools. Data were gathered from national test scores, readiness tests, teachers' interviews, teachers' self-assessment and classroom observation. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyze data. The findings revealed that teachers received feedback on their instruction with superficial results. Slight recommendations could not improve teacher performance and student achievement. Teachers did not use evidence from assessment to improve their students' performance individually. Most teachers misinterpreted the responses on the readiness test of grade 6 students in mathematics and sciences. All teachers assessed themselves as having low ability of teaching. Moreover, there is no feedback for students addressed in the lesson plans. Teachers needed to improve their performance on teaching and assessment individually. All information from the analysis was used to design a feedback system which can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms on teaching and learning. Selection and peer review under the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Servet Bayram Keywords:training self-assessment and classroom observation, low ability of teaching.},

The current study examined how burnout and efficacy relate to student disciplinary actions (e.g., referrals to the principal and suspensions) and referrals for school-based support services (e.g., student support and special education), while adjusting for school-, teacher-, and student-level variables. Data were collected during the fall and spring of a single school year from 491 teachers regarding 9,795 students at 31 elementary schools. Contrary to expectations, having low teacher efficacy in the fall was associated with a reduction in student referrals to the student support team. Also unexpectedly, teachers with high burnout in the fall were less likely to have students who received an out-of-school suspension by the spring. These findings enhance our understanding of the teacher factors that influence student outcomes and may inform the development of screenings and teacher-targeted interventions.

  abstract = {Academic dishonesty (cheating) has been prevalent on college campuses for decades, and the percentage of students reporting cheating varies by college major. This study, based on a survey of 643 undergraduate engineering majors at 11 institutions, used two parallel hierarchical multiple regression analyses to predict the frequency of cheating on exams and the frequency of cheating on homework based on eight blocks of independent variables: demographics, pre-college cheating behavior, co-curricular participation, plus five blocks organized around Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (moral obligation not to cheat, attitudes about cheating, evaluation of the costs and benefits of cheating, perceived social pressures to cheat or not to cheat, and perceived effectiveness of academic dishonesty policies). The final models significantly predict 36\% of the variance in "frequency of cheating on exams" and 14\% of the variance in 'frequency of cheating on homework". Students don't see cheating as a single construct and their decisions to cheat or not to cheat are influenced differently depending on the type of assessment. Secondary findings are that a student's conviction that cheating is wrong no matter what the circumstances is a strong deterrent to cheating across types of assessment and that a student who agrees that he/ she would cheat in order to alleviate stressful situations is more likely to cheat on both exams and homework.},

A common allegation is that suppressor effects rarely replicate and have little substantive import. We present substantive examples from two established research domains to counter this skepticism. In the first domain, we show how measures of guilt and shame act consistently as mutual suppressors: Adding shame into a regression equation increases the negative association between guilt and aggression, whereas adding guilt increases the positive association between shame and aggression. In the second domain, we show how the effects of self-esteem and narcissism operate consistently as mutual suppressors: That is, adding narcissism into a regression equation increases the negative association between self-esteem and antisocial behavior, whereas adding self-esteem increases the positive association between narcissism and antisocial behavior. Discussion addresses the different implications for suppressors in theoretical and variable selection applications.},

Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

Yet, effect size was often reported in three indices, namely, the unadjusted R 2, Cohen's d, and {$\eta$}2 with a simple labeling of small, medium, or large, according to Cohen's (1969) criteria. In this article, the authors present several alternatives to Cohen's d to help researchers conceptualize effect size beyond standardized mean differences for between-subject designs with two groups. The alternative effect size estimators are organized into a typology and are empirically contrasted with Cohen's d in terms of purposes, usages, statistical properties, interpretability, and the potential for meta-analysis. Several sound alternatives are identified to supplement the reporting of Cohen's d. The article concludes with a discussion of the choice of standardizers, the importance of assumptions, and the possibility of extending sound alternative effect size indices to other research contexts.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTCognitive interviewing (CI) provides a method of systematically collecting validity evidence of response processes for questionnaire items. CI involves a range of techniques for prompting individuals to verbalise their responses to items. One such technique is concurrent verbalisation, as developed in Think Aloud Protocol (TAP). This article investigates the value of the technique for validating questionnaire items administered to young people in international surveys. To date, the literature on TAP has focused on allaying concerns about reactivity \textendash{} whether response processes are affected by thinking aloud. This article investigates another concern, namely the completeness of concurrent verbalisations \textendash{} the extent to which respondents verbalise their response processes.

  abstract = {This article focuses on the evaluation of homework behavior of 8th-grade high school students from the perspective of self-regulated learning. For this purpose, the extracurricular learning behavior was analysed by means of process data collected daily over seven weeks (n=115) and afterwards, the adequacy of the underlying process model of self-regulation (Schmitz, 2001; Schmitz \& Wiese, 2006) was verified. The results provide evidence for the adequacy of the process model of self-regulation for the extracurricular context. Furthermore, the process survey led to precise and exact information about specific aspects of self-regulation regarding the extracurricular learning behavior. In this connection, this article addresses, in particular, emotions during learning and learning time (the average learning time, the process of preparation for a class test, the relationship between starting time of homework and the effectiveness of learning). Zielsetzung der Studie ist die Untersuchung des Hausaufgabenverhaltens von Sch{\"u}lern der 8. Klasse des Gymnasiums aus der Perspektive der Selbstregulation. Mit Hilfe von {\"u}ber sieben Wochen t{\"a}glich erhobenen Prozessdaten (standardisiertes Tagebuch) wurde bei 115 Sch{\"u}lern das au{\ss}erschulische Lernverhalten untersucht und die Angemessenheit des zu Grunde gelegten Prozessmodells der Selbstregulation (Schmitz, 2001; Schmitz \& Wiese, 2006) wurde {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. Die Ergebnisse geben Hinweise auf die Angemessenheit des Prozessmodells der Selbstregulation f{\"u}r den au{\ss}erschulischen Kontext. Weiterhin konnte die Prozesserhebung pr{\"a}zise Informationen zu spezifischen Aspekten des Selbstregulationsansatzes hinsichtlich des au{\ss}erschulischen Lernverhaltens liefern. Hierbei wird insbesondere auf die Emotionen beim Lernen sowie auf verschiedene Aspekte der Lernzeit (durchschnittliche Lernzeit, Verlauf der Vorbereitung auf eine Klassenarbeit, Zusammenhang zwischen Hausaufgabenbeginn und Effektivit{\"a}t des Lernens) eingegangen.},

The most important hypothesis was that perceptions of trust and credibility are dependent on three factors: perceptions of knowledge and expertise; perceptions of openness and honesty; and perceptions of concern and care. In the second part, models were constructed with perceptions of trust and credibility as the dependent variable. The goal was to examine the data for findings with direct policy implications. One such finding was that defying a negative stereotype is key to improving perceptions of trust and credibility.},

Aims: This research tested two separate structural models of epistemological beliefs, learning approaches, reflective thinking and academic performance among tertiary students over a period of 12 months. Sample: Participants were first-year Arts (N = 616; 271 females, 345 males) and second-year Mathematics (N = 581; 241 females, 341 males) university students. Method: Students' epistemological beliefs were measured with the Schommer epistemological questionnaire (EQ, Schommer, 1990). Reflective thinking was measured with the reflective thinking questionnaire (RTQ, Kember et al., 2000). Student learning approaches were measured with the revised study process questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F, Biggs, Kember, \{\&\} Leung, 2001). LISREL 8 was used to test two structural equation models - the cross-lag model and the causal-mediating model. Results: In the cross-lag model involving Arts students, structural equation modelling showed that epistemological beliefs influenced student learning approaches rather than the contrary. In the causal-mediating model involving Mathematics students, the results indicate that both epistemological beliefs and learning approaches predicted reflective thinking and academic performance. Furthermore, learning approaches mediated the effect of epistemological beliefs on reflective thinking and academic performance. Results of this study are significant as they integrated the three theoretical frameworks within the one study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {Background: Recently research evidence emphasizes two main lines of inquiry, namely the relations between future time perspective (FTP), achievement goals (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) and study processing strategies, and the relations between epistemological beliefs, achievement goals and study processing strategies. To date, however, there have been very few attempts made to amalgamate these two strands of inquiry within one study and how they in totality determine the success of academic learning. Aims: This study proposed and tested a conceptual model of relationships among FTP, epistemological beliefs, achievement goals (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance), study processing strategies and academic performance. Sample: Two hundred and seventy-five tertiary second-year students (167 females, 108 males) enrolled in a university in the Pacific participated in this study. Method: Likert-scale inventories were used to elicit relevant data from students; for example, the epistemological questionnaire (EQ; Schommer, 1990) and the Zimbardo time perspective inventory (Zimbardo \{\&\} Boyd, 1999). Academic performance was collated from students' course and final exam marks in the course educational psychology. LISREL 8.72 and SPSS 15 was used to test and evaluate the conceptual model proposed. Results: Latent variables procedures supported the conceptual model in general, although not all hypothesized paths were significant. MANOVA indicated no gender differences in the five theoretical frameworks or academic performance. Discussion: The determinants of academic performance from our findings are deep and surface processing strategies. Furthermore, the established supports the mediating roles of deep processing strategies, mastery goals, and performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals.

Biology students (n = 25) and humanities students (n = 26) who varied in their epistemological beliefs learned with a hierarchical hypertext about the topic of genetic fingerprinting. During their learning processes, logfiles and questionnaire data were collected. Results indicate that students do metacognitively calibrate their learning process to the complexity of the presented learning material, e.g. by processing more complex deeper-level nodes longer. Furthermore, these calibration processes were significantly related to epistemological beliefs. For example, more 'sophisticated' epistemological beliefs were associated with processing more nodes, whereas more 'na\{\textbackslash{}"i\}ve' beliefs were related to spending more time on single nodes. Both effects were especially pronounced on deeper hierarchical hypertext levels. Prior domain knowledge also had an impact, especially on comprehensibility ratings: biology students considered all nodes more comprehensible than humanities students. Additionally, epistemological beliefs as well as prior domain knowledge were also significantly associated with the learning outcome: for example, more prior domain knowledge led to significantly higher learning outcome.

Based on the COPES-model (Winne \& Hadwin, 1998) the impact of epistemological beliefs on learning is tested here experimentally. In this study, students (21 humanities students, 14 biology students) had to solve five tasks of different complexity (Anderson et al., 2001) with a hypertext on "genetic fingerprinting". Results indicate that students adapted their concurrent thoughts and concurrent actions to task complexity in this enactment stage. An epistemological sensitisation was administered that elicited more "sophisticated" beliefs and caused more elaborate learning processes. For example, students with this sensitisation employed more metacognitive planning, especially for more complex tasks. Additionally, effects of prior domain knowledge were investigated.},

Based on this conceptual analysis I argue for two extensions of this construct: In addition to traditional applications, the methodology should be transferred to also measure calibration between students' metacognitive control processes (traditionally, only students' metacognitive judgments were considered) and important external criteria (traditionally, judgments were only compared to students' own performance). As an illustrative example, one application context will be highlighted where these proposed extensions would alleviate potential problems with the traditional conceptualization: While students' idiosyncratic task definitions constitute unwanted error variance in the traditional account it would be possible to investigate them as a primary research question within this extended notion. More specifically, it would be possible to investigate how well students' learning processes match objective task demands. I will put forward theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of these suggestions.},

  abstract = {Theories of self-regulated learning assume that learners flexibly adapt their learning process to external task demands and that this is positively related to performance. In this study, university students (n = 119) solved three tasks that greatly differed in complexity. Their learning processes were captured in detail by task-specific questionnaires and computer-generated log files. Results indicate that students adapted almost all learning processes significantly to task complexity. For example, students accessed more hypertext pages for complex tasks than for simple tasks. However, this kind of adaptation was not consistently related to performance. For variables capturing learners' self-regulation, such as the number of accessed hypertext pages, more pronounced adaptation was significantly and positively related to performance even when learners' general processing depth was statistically controlled. Results were less consistent for variables capturing learners' self-monitoring, such as their judged task complexity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whereas, in this context, there are no empirical findings on the efficiency of school inspectorates in Germany, international studies show that, as a rule, school inspectorates do not succeed in bringing about an improvement in performance. However, these findings are usually not very reliable due to problems with the random samples chosen for the studies. The contribution for the first time examines for the German context which effects on student performance are empirically verifiable, using the school inspectorate Hamburg as an example. The investigation is based on trend data on Hamburg's central school leaving exam and on longitudinal data provided by the study "Students' competencies and attitudes" (German abbreviation: KESS). Possible problems with random samples are explicitly taken into account in the analyses in order to be able to come up with empirically reliable findings on the effects of school inspections on student performance.

They then constructed, practiced, and applied SQL commands, and evaluated their own understanding using the multimedia. Research data were collected through an SQL achievement test, small projects, and a questionnaire. The results showed that the students who participated in this developed instructional unit had better ability to apply SQL to a database compared to other groups of students.

This study focuses on the year-to-year stability of observational and student survey measures, drawing on data from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?s Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) study. Results suggest that the observational and student survey measures used in MET are somewhat more stable than measures of teachers? contributions to student learning, but the stability is lower than that found in comparable measures in higher education.

Schommer has argued that the concept is multidimensional and consists of four distinct dimensions, the structure of knowledge, the stability of knowledge, the ability of learning and the speed of learning. The aim of the present study is to explore the structure of epistemic beliefs in a Greek sample, according to the theoretical model of Schommer, and how these beliefs are related to academic performance and other demographic and non demographic variables. The sample was composed by 470 students attending the three grades of upper high school. The students responded to the Epistemological Belief Questionnaire (Schommer, 2000). The results showed that the structure of the epistemological beliefs is in accordance to Schommer's theoretical model as regards the four dimensions and that the dimension structure of knowledge was the strongest factor. Low reliability rates lead to doubts regarding Schommer's conceptual model. Moreover, it was found that ability of learning and stability of knowledge significantly contribute to the prediction of academic performance and that higher grades are related to sophisticated EBs. It was also found that girls have more sophisticated EBs than boys in the speed of learning, and that older students have more sophisticated EBs in the stability of knowledge. Similar findings were found for the students of the theoretical study direction in terms of the stability and the structure of knowledge.

This is surprising in light of the fact that during the last 25 years, educator competence has been increasingly determined by student performance on various large-scale examinations. Government agencies typically administer these exams, unapologetically aiming them at appraising educators' effectiveness. Yet most teachers and administrators are unfamiliar with how such large-scale tests are put together or polished. According to the author, it is understandable why so many of today's educators are uninformed about education measurement. What most teachers and administrators know about education testing harks back to those days when, as students themselves, they were on the receiving end of classroom and standardized tests. If educators thoroughly understood a dozen measurement fundamentals, they could knowledgeably deal as professionals with the key assessment related issues that seem to make today's education world spin.},

In this study we in- vestigate the effects of ignoring the nested nature of data in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The bias incurred by ignoring clustering is examined in terms of model fit and standardized parameter estimates, which are usually of interest to researchers who use CFA. We find that the disaggregation approach increases model misfit, especially when the intraclass correlation (ICC) is high, whereas the aggregation approach results in accurate detection of modelmisfit in themacro level. Standardized parameter estimates from the disaggregation and aggregation ap- proaches are deviated toward the values of themacro- andmicro-level standardized parameter estimates, respectively. The degree of deviation depends on ICC and cluster size, particularly for the aggregation method. The standard errors of standardized parameter estimates from the disaggregation approach depend on the macro-level item communalities. Those from the aggregation approach underestimate the standard errors in multilevel CFA(MCFA), especially when ICC is low. Thus, we conclude that MCFA or an alternative approach should be used if possible.},

Furthermore it is necessary to have realistic awareness of one's own fragmentary understanding and to avoid the ``illusion of explanatory depth'' (Rosenblit \{\&\} Keil, 2002). In order to research on adults' capability to choose between disciplines who might be relevant for a science topic, N = 520 secondary school students were asked to choose, which of 22 scientific disciplines (e.g. math, geology, biology) should contribute to a book about tide and float. They were also asked to assess their own knowledge about the theme. Influence of epistemological beliefs has been tested by an epistemological sensitization in an experimental design. The epistemological sensitization significantly influences students' self-assessment of knowledge and discipline rating. Students with sophisticated epistemological beliefs were more critical about their own knowledge about tide and flow, chose significantly pertinent and -by tendency- potential pertinent disciplines more and declined non-pertinent disciplines more.},

Few studies have attempted to determine whether these periods are sufficient to provide reliable measures of instructional quality. Using generalizability theory, this study investigates (a) how three dimensions of instructional quality - classroom management, personal learning support, and cognitive activation of students - vary between the lessons of a specific teacher, and (b) how many lessons per teacher are necessary to establish sufficiently reliable measures of these dimensions. Analyses are based on ratings of five lessons for 38 teachers. Classroom management and personal learning support were stable across lessons, whereas cognitive activation showed high variability. Consequently, one lesson per teacher suffices to measure classroom management and personal learning support, whereas nine lessons would be needed for cognitive activation. The importance of advancing our theoretical understanding of cognitive activation is discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, these MLM approaches do not accommodate mediation pathways with Level-2 outcomes and may produce conflated estimates of between- and within-level components of indirect effects. Moreover, these methods have each appeared in isolation, so a unified framework that integrates the existing methods, as well as new multilevel mediation models, is lacking. Here we show that a multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) paradigm can overcome these 2 limitations of mediation analysis with MLM. We present an integrative 2-level MSEM mathematical framework that subsumes new and existing multilevel mediation approaches as special cases. We use several applied examples and accompanying software code to illustrate the flexibility of this framework and to show that different substantive conclusions can be drawn using MSEM versus MLM.},

Data-based decision-making can be defined as teachers' systematic analysis of data sources in order to study and adapt their educational practices for the purpose of maximizing learning results. Teachers must apply the findings from their data use to their personal teaching activities. Therefore, data-based decision-making may be influenced by individual teachers' psychological characteristics. The present study aimed to explore which psychological factors contribute to teachers' data use in a Dutch primary school context. A questionnaire-based quantitative methodology was employed. We included the following psychological constructs: affective and instrumental attitudes, perceived control, social norms, self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and intentions regarding data use. Results of the path analysis showed that perceived control, instrumental attitude, and intention regarding data use all significantly influenced data use. Additionally, intention was found to be a mediator of the relation between affective attitude and data use. Interventions aimed at data-based decision-making should take these psychological factors into account to increase teachers' implementation of data-based decision-making for instruction and, consequently, educational quality.},

While past research indicates that presenting risk information in a frequency format is superior to relative risk and probability formats, the optimal characteristics of frequency formats are still unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the features of 1000 person frequency diagrams (pictographs) which result in the greatest speed and accuracy of graphical perception. Methods: Participants estimated the difference in chance of survival when taking or not taking Drug A, on a pictograph format, varying by mode (one-graph/two-graph), direction (vertical/horizontal), and shading (shaded/unshaded), and their preferences for the different formats. Their understanding of different components of the 1000 person diagram was assessed. Responses were timed and scored for accuracy. Results: Horizontal pictographs were perceived faster and more accurately than vertical formats. Two-graph pictographs were perceived faster than one-graph formats. Shading reduced response time in two-graph formats, but increased response times in one-graph formats. Shaded and one-graph pictographs were preferred. Conclusions: As shading and one-graph formats were preferred, further clarification as to why shading negatively impacts on response times in the one-graph format is warranted. Practice Implications: Horizontal pictographs are optimal. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Perceived stress correlated with increases of cortisol levels during the 1st hr after awakening after dexamethasone pretreatment. In addition, Ss scoring high on burnout showed lower overall cortisol secretion on all sampling days, and a higher suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone administration. In the subgroup of Ss with both high levels of perceived stress and of burnout, a lower overall cortisol secretion was observed on the 1st 2 days, with stronger increases during the 1st hr after awakening after dexamethasone suppression. This subgroup also showed the lowest self-esteem, the highest external locus of control, and the highest number of somatic complaints.

The participants (N = 15,552) took part in the base year (1988), first follow-up (1990), and second follow-up (1992) of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS). Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the NELS data set while controlling for the effects of family background, previous achievement, gender, and ethnicity. Employment had an overall negative and curvilinear effect on high school GPA. Students who worked fewer than 12 hr per week fared better academically than those students who were not employed. A significant decline in academic performance was observed when students worked more than 11\textendash{}13 hr per week.},

  abstract = {In conventional structural equation models, all latent variables and indicators vary between units (typically subjects) and are assumed to be independent across units. The latter assumption is violated in multilevel settings where units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster de- pendence. Different approaches to extending structural equation models for such multilevel settings are examined. The most common approach is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models. An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional struc- tural equation models to be `tricked' into estimating the model. However, the standard implementation of this approach does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or ob- served variables at a lower level, and does not allow for indicators varying at higher levels. A multilevel regression (or path) model formulation is therefore suggested in which some of the response variables and some of the explanatory variables at the different levels are latent and measured by multiple indicators. The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling (GLLAMM) framework allows such models to be specified by simply letting the usual model for the structural part of a structural equation model include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. Models of this kind are applied to the U.S. sample of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 to investigate the relation- ship between the school-level latent variable `teacher excellence' and the student-level latent variable `reading ability', each measured by multiple ordinal indicators.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The end of the course evaluation has become an integral part of education management in almost every academic institution. The existing automated evaluation method primarily employs the Likert scale based quantitative scores provided by students about the delivery of the course and the knowledge of the instructor. The feedback is subsequently used to improve the quality of the teaching and often for the annual appraisal process. In addition to the Likert scale questions, the evaluation form typically contains open-ended questions where students can write general comments/feedback that might not be covered by the fixed questions. The textual feedback, however, is usually provided to teachers and administration and due to its nonquantitative nature is frequently not processed to gain more insight. This paper aims to address this aspect by applying several text analytics methods on students' feedback. The paper not only presents a sentiment analysis based metric, which is shown to be highly correlated with the aggregated Likert scale scores, but also provides new insight into a teacher's performance with the help of tag clouds, sentiment score, and other frequency-based filters.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Describes everyday experience methods from both conceptual and practical vantage points. The chapter begins with a conceptual rationale, covering the paradigm's special perspective on social behavior and its contribution to social psychological methodology. Beyond methodology, the authors show how everyday experience methods offer a unique conceptual window on a phenomenon or theory. They then review several specific protocols relevant to research in social and personality psychology. The 2 subsequent sections address practical matters arising in everyday experience research and special statistical techniques for capitalizing on the extensive data sets typically obtained. Finally, the authors consider the role of everyday experience studies to complement other methods in programmatic research. The stated goal for the chapter is to make readers aware of the potential benefits of everyday experience methods and to provide a practical guide for incorporating them into a research program.

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that learning from worked-out examples is of major importance for initial skill acquisition in well-structured domains such as mathematics. However, only those learners who actively process the presented examples profit noticeably from this learning mode. Specifically, the learning outcomes depend on how well the learners explain the solution steps presented in the examples to themselves (`self-explanation effect''). In a series of studies on learning mathematics from examples, learners' spontaneous self-explanations and instructional means used to encourage self-explanations were investigated. In this research, the following main findings were obtained. Most learners were rather passive with respect to their spontaneous self-explanations. Among the active and successful learners, two subgroups employing different self-explanation styles could be identified. With regard to the instructional means used to induce effective example processing, it turned out that to employ ``learning by teaching'' in order to stimulate explanation activities was of very limited use. Attempts to directly train for or elicit certain types of self-explanations were more successful. However, even in the latter case, self-explanations had inherent deficits (e.g., proneness to errors). Thus, we sought to design learning arrangements that try to integrate self-explanations with well-timed and well-adapted instructional explanations (e.g., from tutors) in order to enhance students' problem-solving skills.},

In later stages, however, solving problems is superior. In this contribution, theoretical analyses of different types of cognitive load and their changes over the stages of skill acquisition are presented. Two basic arguments are put forth: (a) Intrinsic cognitive load gradually decreases so that a gradual increase of problem-solving demands is possible without inducing cognitive overload. (b) In contrast to the earlier stages, different learner activities during the later stages constitute either germane or extraneous load, because different instructional goals are to be achieved. Based on these analyses, we propose a fading procedure in which problem-solving elements are successively integrated into example study until the learners are expected to solve problems on their own. Empirical evidence supporting this fading procedure is provided, and future research is proposed that focuses on how to ensure that the fading procedure is adaptive to the learners' prior knowledge levels.

(Educ Psychol Rev 25:291-302, ) have suggested refraining from practice and policy recommendations in primary educational research articles, in particular because primary research journals are not the appropriate outlet for such recommendations, the evidence provided by one research article is usually not sufficient, and making bold statements about practice in primary research trivializes the challenges of practice implementations. This commentary on Robinson et al. is a plea to continue providing such recommendations in primary research journals because much of educational research is not only theoretically but also practically grounded (i.e., use-inspired basic research). Contributions to the discourse on practice and theory are an intrinsic and productive part of educational research, even if some recommendations may turn out to be oversimplified or even wrong in further research. Nevertheless, there is agreement with Robinson et al. that we should usually not formulate general, sweeping recommendations. More modest and, therefore, legitimate types of practice recommendations are proposed, and conditions are discussed when such recommendations in primary research journals seem to be justified. Finally, some thoughts on how to communicate practice recommendations to practitioners were outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Interest and interest development as described by Hidi and Renninger's (2006) Four-Phase Model of Interest Development are (a) defined and then (b) contextualized in light of other conceptualizations that focus on specific aspects of interest (such as emotion, experience, task features, value, and vocational interest) and issues pertaining to the operationalization and measurement of interest. Following this, research addressing the development of interest is overviewed, with particular attention to (a) the triggering of interest in both earlier and later phases of interest, (b) maintaining interest once it has been triggered, (c) fluctuations in interest, and (d) shifts between phases in the development of interest. Finally, a Punnett square is employed to suggest next steps and open questions in the study of interest development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Yet, it has not been quantitatively assessed how the perception of scientific uncertainties relates to engagement with science on an individual level. In this article, we report the development and testing of a new questionnaire in English and German measuring the perceived uncertainty of scientific evidence. Results indicate that the scale is reliable and valid in both language versions and that its two subscales are differentially related to measures of engagement: Science-friendly attitudes were positively related only to 'subjectively' perceived uncertainty, whereas interest in science as well as behavioural engagement actions and intentions were largely uncorrelated. We conclude that perceiving scientific knowledge to be uncertain is only weakly, but positively related to engagement with science.},

  abstract = {Research has been carried out on students' epistemological development in higher education for at least 50. years. Researchers on both sides of the Atlantic have converged on accounts that describe students' epistemological development in terms of a sequence or hierarchy of qualitatively distinct stages or positions. The rich qualitative data obtained from longitudinal investigations do demonstrate intellectual changes, but whether the same scheme fits all students and whether the changes found are a specific result of exposure to higher education are open to debate. Well-validated quantitative instruments that could be used to measure epistemological development in large samples of students are still lacking. Unresolved issues include: whether students can adopt multiple epistemological positions; whether these are culturally and contextually specific; and whether they are mental entities, discursive practices or social constructions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

As such, they serve an important function in regulating the use of epistemic strategies such as knowledge-based validation of information and checking arguments for internal consistency. We report results from two studies that investigated the effects epistemological attitudes and beliefs on the use of epistemic strategies in academic learning and the motivational states that mediate these effects. Study 1 (N\,=\,289) tested a mediation model with epistemological attitudes (separate vs. connected knowing) and textual characteristics as distal predictors, and learning goals (learning factual knowledge vs. developing an own standpoint) as mediator variables. Separate knowing had large indirect effects on the use of epistemic strategies via the goal to develop an own point of view. In addition, learners adapted their learning goals and epistemic strategies depending on objective characteristics and the perceived familiarity of the texts they read. In Study 2 (N\,=\,124), epistemological beliefs concerning the uncertainty of knowledge increased the use of epistemic strategies only when extrinsic study motivation was low. A mediated moderation model established this effect to be mediated by specific epistemic curiosity. These results illuminate the mechanisms of how epistemological attitudes and beliefs affect self-regulated learning. In contrast to other types of learning strategies, the use of epistemic strategies seems to be strongly and consistently linked to epistemological attitudes and beliefs.},

In a CR CO trial, clusters of subjects are randomly allocated to a sequence of interventions. Under this design, each subject is either included in only one of the treatment periods (CO at cluster level) or in both periods (CO at subject level). In this study, the efficiency of both CR CO trials relative to the CR trial without CO is demonstrated. Furthermore, the optimal allocation of clusters and subjects given a fixed budget or desired power level is discussed.},

Certain types of third variables\textemdash{}colliders and mediators\textemdash{}should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest.

The study overcomes limitations in prior studies in that it (1) assessed personal characteristics before study entry in order to exclude "contamination" effects, (2) selected an appropriate control group, and (3) differentiated between STEM and non-STEM study majors. The results did not find any empirical support for the negative selection hypothesis in terms of cognitive and personality characteristics in Germany.

The online tool ASSISTments (a) provides timely feedback and hints to students as they do homework and (b) gives teachers timely, organized information about students' work. To test this prediction, we analyzed data from 43 schools that participated in a random assignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides every seventh-grade student with a laptop to take home. Results showed that the intervention significantly increased student scores on an end-of- the-year standardized mathematics assessment as compared with a control group that continued with existing homework practices. Students with low prior mathematics achievement benefited most. The intervention has potential for wider adoption. Keywords:},

  abstract = {Our first purpose in this article is to contribute case study, classroom-based evidence of the role of epistemology in student learning. Most existing research has taken place through specialized interviews or surveys, but "there may not be a clean correspondence between how students respond to these questions and how they actually approach learning", so it is important to study the nature and role of epistemologies in everyday settings. We present a conversation that took place in J. Phelan's eighth-grade science class, and we give evidence that epistemological knowledge played a significant role in the students' approach to an activity. Our second purpose is to contribute evidence of variability, to promote a change in the ontology by which researchers understand personal epistemologies. Currently, researchers mostly conceptualize personal epistemology in terms of unitary stages of development or systems of belief. There is, however, evidence of variability in personal epistemologies as we review following and as we show in the eighth-graders' conversation. We have analyzed an episode of inquiry in science among a group of eighth-grade students with respect to their epistemologies. At the outset of the conversation, prior to the teacher's intervention, the indications in the data are consistent with previous research that has identified counterproductive beliefs: The students treat knowledge as comprised of isolated, simple pieces of information expressed with specific vocabulary and provided by authority.

  abstract = {This article analyses the differential development of discipline-specific epistemic beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the nature of knowledge) in computer science and psychology. With regard to computer science, a ``hard'' discipline, we expected absolute beliefs (knowledge as objective ``truths'') to increase over time. In contrast, in the more ``soft'' discipline of psychology, we expected absolute beliefs to be low and stable, and multiplistic beliefs (knowledge as subjective ``opinions'') to follow an inversely U-shaped trajectory. Hypotheses were tested in a three-semester long four-wave study with 226 undergraduates. Data were analysed by multi-group growth modelling for parallel processes. In computer science, absolute beliefs indeed increased over the study period. In psychology, an initial increase in multiplistic beliefs was followed by a steep decrease. We therefore suggest that epistemic ``sophistication'' should be conceived of as a flexible adaptation of epistemic judgments to the characteristics of specific contexts, and not as a generalized developmental sequence.},

  abstract = {As the use of web-based homework delivery and checking systems expands, we have greater need to evaluate how students engage with these systems and how changes in the systems influence student behavior. Reported here is the assessment of WeBWorK, an open-source web-based homework program used largely in postsecondary math and science courses, with recent extension to high school courses. WeBWorK draws from a large library of problems to generate individual assignments and provides immediate feedback about correctness of students' answers. WeBWorK allows entries in multiple choice, formula and numerical formats. The entries recorded by the system create an extensive database of student interactions with the system. In our two-part study, we (1) review 2387 student surveys about WeBWorK in three semesters across a range of mathematics courses and (2) test a model designed to classify student responses to system feedback, permitting a fine-grained analysis of the system's records at the keystroke level for a cohort of 96 Calculus I students. Based on this data, our goals are, first, to understand how students use the system and respond to its feedback; second, to analyze the impact of upgrades to the system interface on student users, and third, to evaluate the efficiency of training raters to classify student records. We find that the introduction of new features to the WeBWorK interface (improvements generated by our initial assessment) were welcomed by most students and reduced the overall number of submitted errors by half by the third year of the study. Importantly, the interface improvements reduced the number of errors that were not pedagogically useful. We also find that our error classification model, called here the Student Response Model, was a good fit for our student sample, as reflected by inter-rater reliability of three raters who coded the student records. In sum, our error classification model appears to be useful for analyzing formula entries. To make this assessment model widely available, we designed a system of exercises to train raters to classify student response files for WeBWorK and similar web-based systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One obstacle to the adoption of Bayes factor in psychological science is a lack of guidance and software.

  abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind overconfidence in Studies 11 and 12, and discuss the implications of our findings for the roles of intuitive theories in concepts and cognition. ?? 2002 Leonid Rozenblit.

Personal epistemological development and epistemological beliefs involve: how individuals come to know, the theories and beliefs they hold about knowing, and the manner in which such epistemological premises are a part of and an influence on the cognitive processes of thinking and reasoning (Hofer and Pintrich, 1997, p. 88). In the classroom, students are exposed to new ideas, theories, and information from different sources every day. Students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing influence the way they perceive and respond to the learning situations they encounter. For example, as students study an historical event such as the US Civil War, they may have the opportunity to examine different sources of information such as a textbook that describes the war, personal letters written by soldiers, and/or analyses of the war published by history experts. The views of the students and other aspects of the epistemic climate (Bendixen and Rule, 2004) of their learning environment influence how these students will proceed. For instance, learners may be passive or active in this process, they may be asked to weigh evidence about these different historical sources and make their own warranted judgments, or they may be expected to find the one correct version of what happened and not question it. In addition, students may think that historical information is more relative and open to interpretation while a subject such as mathematics leaves very little room for student interpretation.

  abstract = {Linear logistic models with relaxed assumptions (LLRA) are a flexible tool for item-based measurement of change or multidimensional Rasch models. Their key features are to allow for multidimensional items and mutual dependencies of items as well as imposing no assumptions on the distribution of the latent trait in the population. Inference for such models becomes possible within a framework of conditional maximum likelihood estimation. In this paper we introduce and illustrate new functionality from the R package eRm for fitting, comparing and plotting of LLRA models for dichotomous and polytomous responses with any number of time points, treatment groups and categorical covariates.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used routinely in the development and validation of assessment instruments. One of the most significant challenges when one is performing EFA is determining how many factors to retain. Parallel analysis (PA) is an effective stopping rule that compares the eigenvalues of randomly generated data with those for the actual data. PA takes into account sampling error, and at present it is widely considered the best available method. We introduce a variant of PA that goes even further by reproducing the observed correlation matrix rather than generating random data. Comparison data (CD) with known factorial structure are first generated using 1 factor, and then the number of factors is increased until the reproduction of the observed eigenvalues fails to improve significantly. We evaluated the performance of PA, CD with known factorial structure, and 7 other techniques in a simulation study spanning a wide range of challenging data conditions. In terms of accuracy and robustness across data conditions, the CD technique outperformed all other methods, including a nontrivial superiority to PA. We provide program code to implement the CD technique, which requires no more specialized knowledge or skills than performing PA.},

  abstract = {Parents can influence the health behaviors of their children by engaging in supportive behaviors (e.g., playing outside with their child, limiting recreational screen time). How, and the extent to which parents engage in supportive behaviors may be influenced by perceived barriers. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the frequency, and types, of barriers to providing parental support are dependent on the type of child health behavior being supported (i.e., physical activity, recreational screen time reduction, healthy eating, and sleep). Study participants were 1140 Ontario parents with at least one child under the age of 18 who completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) survey about parental support behaviors. Open-ended responses about perceived barriers to parental support were coded, and aggregated to meta-categories adopted from the social-ecological model (i.e., individual child, individual parent, interpersonal, environmental). Freidman rank sum tests were used to assess differences across child behaviors. Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni adjustments were used as a post hoc test for significant Freidman results. There were more barriers reported for supporting physical activity than for any other child behavior (ps\,{$<$}\,.01, As\,{$\geq$}\,.53). Parents reported more parent level and environmental level barriers to supporting child physical activity versus other behaviors (ps\,{$<$}\,.001, As\,{$\geq$}\,.55), child level barriers were more frequently reported for supporting healthy eating and sleep (ps\,{$<$}\,.001, As\,{$\geq$}\,.57), and interpersonal barriers were more frequently reported for supporting recreational screen time reduction (ps\,{$<$}\,.001, As\,{$\geq$}\,.52). Overall, parents reported more child and parent level barriers versus interpersonal and environmental barriers to supporting child health. Parents experience a variety of barriers to supporting their children's health behaviors. Differences in types of barriers across child health behaviors emerged; however, some frequently reported barriers (e.g., child preferences) were common across behaviors. Interventions promoting parental support should consider strategies that can accommodate parents' busy schedules, and relate to activities that children find enjoyable. Creating supportive environments that help facilitate support behaviors, while minimizing parent level barriers, may be of particular benefit. Future research should explore the impact of barriers on parental support behaviors, and effective strategies for overcoming common barriers.},

Ss were classified as having a dualistic (fact-oriented) or a relativistic (context-oriented) conception of knowledge on the basis of their ratings of attitude statements drawn from the work of W. G. Perry (1968). Comprehension criteria reported by dualists more often involved the knowledge category found in the B. S. Bloom et al (1956) book, Taxonomy, and those reported by relativists, the comprehension or application categories. The nature and number of reported comprehension criteria were found to be predictive of course grades. Ss reporting the use of comprehension or application criteria earned better grades than those reporting the use of knowledge criteria; Ss reporting the use of more than one criterion earned better grades than those reporting the use of a single criterion. These data suggest that one's epistemological beliefs may dictate one's choice of comprehension standards and that these epistemological standards, in turn, may control the effectiveness of one's text processing efforts.

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

We proposed level-specific test statistics for the test of overall model fit, comparative fit index, and root mean squared error of approximation using partially saturated models, and we also considered another level-specific approach proposed by Yuan and Bentler (2007). A simulation study showed that the standard approach failed to detect the lack of fit at the group level. The fit indexes produced by the level-specific approaches both successfully detected the lack of model fit at each level. There were only minor differences in the performance of the 2 level-specific approaches.},

The procedure presented in this article provides a solution to this problem.

Testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-2 groups and testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-1 groups are illustrated using empirical examples.

A sample of 4th graders (N = 118) with a home language other than German from 18 elementary school classes participated in the experimental study. Students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: After having been exposed to either explicit, implicit and no stereotype priming, the children were supposed to learn difficult new words. Confirming our expectations, compared to the control group condition vocabulary growth was inhibited in the priming conditions, and particularly strongly in the explicit stereotype priming condition. Supplementing other studies, we could show that students in learning situations revealed lower vocabulary growth when their belonging to the group of students with ``a home language other than German'' was emphasized. Unexpectedly, the effect of the treatment was not moderated by children's ethnical identification as German or member of their culture of origin.

  abstract = {It has long been a goal of science education in the United States that students leave school with a robust understanding of the nature of science. Decades of research show that this does not happen. Inquiry-based instruction is advocated as a means for developing such understanding, although there is scant direct evidence that it does. There is a gap between what is known about students' inquiry practices and their epistemological beliefs about science. Studies of students' ideas about epistemological aspects of formal science are unlikely to shed any light on how they perceive their own inquiry efforts. Conversely, inquiry-based instruction that does not account for the epistemological beliefs that guide students' inquiry stands very little chance of helping students to understand professional science. This paper reviews largely independent lines of research into students' beliefs about the nature of science and their practices of inquiry to argue that students' inquiry is guided by practical epistemologies that are in need of study. An approach to studying practical epistemologies is proposed that has the potential to produce a better psychological theory of epistemological development, as well as to realize goals of a science education that develops scientifically informed citizens. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This review summarizes the broad range of psychological and education research that comprises the study of epistemic cognition, and it identifies various fault lines that currently prevent coherent synthesis of theoretical models and empirical findings. The fault lines include differences in how scholars conceptualize knowledge and cognition, and the contextual nature of epistemic cognition, with consequent differences in accounts of individual development, as well as in research methods. In the coming century, research that can integrate findings among individual, situative, and cultural accounts of cognition may enable the advancement of coherent models of epistemic cognition and its development and support improved educational efforts aimed at such development.},

Besonderes Augenmerk ruht dabei auf der Frage nach Pers{\"o}nlichkeitsfaktoren, die einen gesundheitsf{\"o}rderlichen Umgang mit den Anforderungen des Berufes erleichtern. Zentraler Bezugspunkt unserer Untersuchung, die sich mittlerweile auf Daten von {\"u}ber 7600 P{\"a}- dagoginnen und P{\"a}dagogen st{\"u}tzt, ist das Fragebogenverfahren AVEM (,,Ar- beitsbezogenes Verhaltens- und Erlebensmuster``, Schaarschmidt/Fischer 1996/ 2003). Gesundheitliche Chancen und Risiken werden hierbei {\"u}ber das individuelle Bew{\"a}ltigungsverhalten bestimmt. F{\"u}r die Lehrerschaft ergibt sich ein durchaus problematisches Bild. Der Beruf scheint mit h{\"o}heren gesundheitlichen Risiken behaftet als andere Besch{\"a}ftigungsfelder. Wir beobachten zudem markante Geschlechtsunterschiede: Lehrerinnen leiden offenbar unter gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Belastungen als ihre m{\"a}nnlichen Kollegen. Dagegen lassen sich kaum schulformspezifische oder regionale Unterschiede aufdecken. Die im L{\"a}ngsschnitt festgestellten Entwicklungen weisen {\"u}berdies darauf hin, dass keine Verbesserungen im Sinne spontaner Remission zu erwarten sind. Bezogen auf vier Handlungsfelder werden Schlussfolgerungen zur Ver{\"a}nderung des vorgefundenen Zustandsbildes er{\"o}rtert.},

Current methodology for linear mixed-effects models can accommodate imbalance or missing data in a single response variable, but it cannot handle missing values in multiple responses or additional covariates. Applying a multivariate extension of a popular linear mixed-effects model, we create multiple imputations of missing values for subsequent analyses by a straightforward and effective Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. We also derive and implement a new EM algorithm for parameter estimation which converges more rapidly than traditional EM algorithms because it does not treat the random effects as ``missing data,'' but integrates them out of the likelihood function analytically. These techniques are illustrated on models for adolescent alcohol use in a large school-based prevention trial.},

We evaluate the effect of graphic format elements on perceptions of risk magnitude and perceived truth of data. Preferences for format also were assessed. Participants (254 female primary care patients) viewed a series of hypothetical risk communications regarding the lifetime risk of breast cancer. Identical numeric risk information was presented using different graphic formats. Risk was perceived to be of lower magnitude when communicated with a bar graph as compared with a pictorial display (p {$<$} 0.0001), or with consecutively versus randomly highlighted symbols in a pictorial display (p = 0.0001). Data were perceived to be more true when presented with random versus consecutive highlights in a pictorial display (p {$<$} 0.01). A pictorial display was preferred to a bar graph format for the presentation of breast cancer risk estimates alone (p = 0.001). When considering breast cancer risk in comparison to heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis, however, bar graphs were preferred pictorial displays (p {$<$} 0.001). In conclusion, elements of graphic format used to convey quantitative risk information effects key domains of risk perception. One must be cognizant of these effects when designing risk communication strategies.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents an overview of the concept of burnout. Findings: The roots of the burnout concept seem to be embedded within broad social, economic, and cultural developments that took place in the last quarter of the past century and signify the rapid and profound transformation from an industrial society into a service economy. This social transformation goes along with psychological pressures that may translate into burnout. After the turn of the century, burnout is increasingly considered as an erosion of a positive psychological state. Although burnout seems to be a global phenomenon, the meaning of the concept differs between countries. For instance, in some countries burnout is used as a medical diagnosis, whereas in other countries it is a non-medical, socially accepted label that carries a minimum stigma in terms of a psychiatric diagnosis. Originality/value: The paper documents that the exact meaning of the concept of burnout varies with its context and the intentions of those using the term.

Learning to program computers has gained considerable popularity, and educational systems around the world are encouraging students in schools and even children in kindergartens to engage in programming activities. This popularity is based on the claim that learning computer programming improves cognitive skills, including creativity, reasoning, and mathematical skills. In this meta-analysis, we tested this claim performing a 3-level, random-effects meta-analysis on a sample of 105 studies and 539 effect sizes. We found evidence for a moderate, overall transfer effect (g = 0.49, 95\% CI [0.37, 0.61]) and identified a strong effect for near transfer (g = 0.75, 95\% CI [0.39, 1.11]) and a moderate effect for far transfer (g = 0.47, 95\% CI [0.35, 0.59]). Positive transfer to situations that required creative thinking, mathematical skills, and metacognition, followed by spatial skills and reasoning existed. School achievement and literacy, however, benefited the least from learning to program. Moderator analyses revealed significantly larger transfer effects for studies with untreated control groups than those with treated (active) control groups. Moreover, published studies exhibited larger effects than gray literature. These findings shed light on the cognitive benefits associated with learning computer programming and contribute to the current debate surrounding the conceptualization of computer programming as a form of problem solving.

  shorttitle = {{{SQL Island}}},
  author = {Schildgen, Johannes},
  year = {2014},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {Background: SQL Island is mainly addressed to university students, to help them apply concepts as taught in database lectures, and is suited for exam preparation.
However, it was designed especially for computer-science introducing courses in
schools. We consider writing SQL queries a good method to teach children how to
command a machine, focusing on the accuracy and precision of the input which is
applicable to all programming languages. Our goal was to develop a new type of
educational game, namely a combination of classic programming tutorials and
text-adventure games. With SQL Island, we wanted to put motivation, fun and
action in the learning process.
Description: Imagine you are marooned on an island. The inhabitants only under-
stand the database language SQL. The adventure game SQL Island
(http://www.sql-island.de) is controlled by sending SQL queries which teach the
fundamentals of the language in an entertaining and funny way. The player learns
how to search and manipulate data in a relational database. Prior knowledge of
the SQL language is not required. Tutorials include both the matter of study as
well as a quiz. In text-adventure games, the user controls a fictional character by
using text commands in order to achieve a certain goal. A typical command in said
text-adventure games would be for example: "Collect the ring". In SQL Island, the
user would enter: UPDATE item SET owner = 20 WHERE item = ring. In the begin-
ning of the game, the player is marooned on an island and encounters the people
there. Luckily they are in the company of a pilot who could help you escape but
he is being held captive. The player's task is to earn money, sell items and buy a
sword which will help him to free the pilot from the fetters of the kidnapper. The
system presents the very first SQL queries to help the player find their way
around the island. Following this, they are asked to apply their knowledge in other
queries in order to solve different problems and answer questions. The complex-
ity of the SQL language increases logically and inevitably must be incorporated to
progress and to finally reach the end goal. The game, consisting of 30 levels138
roughly, can be finished in about an hour and will train the player in the basics of
SQL.
Links: SQL Island can be played online: http://www.sql-island.de. On this website,
a game-trailer video can be found, too.}

  abstract = {School quality care has become important in many Western countries. A number of self-evaluation instruments have been developed in response. The goal of these instruments is improving the quality of education. One such system, ZEBO, was developed for performing quality assessment in Dutch primary schools. The use of this self-evaluation instrument was studied in 79 primary schools in The Netherlands over a period of 5 years. The results of the multilevel analyses with repeated measures show that the use of the self-evaluation results had no effect on pupil achievement scores (so far). However, it did have other effects, for example, an impact on the professional development of teachers.

  abstract = {Background: Data-based decision making can lead to increased student achievement; however, schools struggle with the implementation of data-based decision making. Professional development in the use of data is therefore urgently needed. However, professional development is often ineffective in terms of improving the knowledge, skills, and attitude of the receiver. Purpose: We need a more fundamental understanding of how we can increase the effectiveness of data-use-related professional development. This study therefore focuses on the factors influencing a professional development intervention for data-based decision making: the data team procedure. Data teams are teams of teachers and school leaders who collaboratively learn how to use data, following a structured approach and guided by a facilitator from the university. Based on an extensive literature review, we developed a data use framework in which the use of data is influenced by data characteristics, school organization characteristics, and user and team characteristics. Research Design: We conducted case studies. Data Collection: We focused on observing in depth the factors that influence the work of the data teams and interviewing the data team members about these factors. Four data teams of six schools for upper secondary education were followed over a period of 2 years. We observed and analyzed 34 meetings and analyzed 23 interviews, combined with our field notes. Although this pilot study only permits analytical generalization of the findings, the findings provide more in-depth insight into the factors that enable and hinder interventions, focusing on supporting collaborative data use in schools. Findings: The results show that several data characteristics (access and availability of high-quality data), school organizational characteristics (a shared goal, leadership, training and support, involvement of relevant stakeholders), and individual and team characteristics (data literacy, pedagogical content knowledge [PCK], organizational knowledge, attitude, and collaboration) influence the use of data in data teams. The results also show that these influencing factors are interrelated. Conclusions: Schools need support in all aspects of the use of data (from formulation of a problem definition to taking action based on the data). This study can form a starting point for larger studies into the factors influencing these types of professional development interventions to ensure effective implementation and sustainability.},

The results of our hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis from this large-scale quantitative study (N = 1073) show that, on average, teachers appear to score relatively high on data use for accountability and school development. Regarding instruction, however, several data sources are used only on a yearly basis.

  abstract = {Background: Data-based decision-making in education often focuses on the use of summative assessment data in order to bring about improvements in student achievement. However, many other sources of evidence are available across a wide range of indicators. There is potential for school leaders, teachers and students to use these diverse sources more fully to support their work on a range of school improvement goals.
Purpose and sources of evidence: To explore data-based decisionmaking for school improvement, this theoretical paper discusses recent research and literature from different areas of data use in education. These areas include the use of formative assessment data, educational research study findings and `big data'. In particular, the discussion focuses on how school leaders and teachers can use different sources of data to improve the quality of education. Main argument: Based on the literature reviewed, an iterative model of data use for school improvement is described, consisting of defining goals for data use, collecting different types of data or evidence (e.g. formal data, informal data, research evidence and `big data'), sense-making, taking improvement actions and evaluation. Drawing on the literature, research insights are discussed for each of these components, as well as identification of the research gaps that still exist. It is noted that the process of data use does not happen in isolation: data use is influenced by system, organisation and team/individual level factors.
Conclusions: When it comes to using data to improve the quality of teaching and learning, it is evident that some of the most important enablers and barriers include data literacy and leadership. However, what is less well understood is how we can promote the enablers and remove the barriers to unlock, more fully, the potential of data use. Only then can data use lead to sustainable school improvement.},

Data teams consist of teachers and school leaders, who collaboratively analyze data to solve educational problems at their school. Studies show that school leaders can enable and hinder data use in such teams. This study aims at exploring what types of leadership behaviors are applied to support data use in data teams. The results of this study point to five key building blocks for school leaders wanting to build effective data teams in their school: (1) establishing a vision, norms, and goals (e.g., discussing vision, norms, and goals with teachers); (2) providing individualized support (e.g., providing emotional support); (3) intellectual stimulation (e.g., sharing knowledge and providing autonomy); (4) creating a climate for data use (e.g., creating a safe climate focused on improvement rather than accountability, and engaging in data discussions with teachers); and (5) networking to connect different parts of the school organization (e.g., brokering knowledge and creating a network that is committed to data use). Not only formal school leaders, but also teachers, can display these types of behavior. Finally, it is important to stress here that all these building blocks are needed to create sustainable data use practices. These building blocks can be used in a new wave of data-informed decision making in schools, in which teachers and school leaders collaboratively use a multitude of different data sources to improve education.},

The PVQ is an instrument newly developed by Shalom Schwartz to test his theory on basic human values. The 40-item PVQ is conceptually different from the "Schwartz Value Survey" (SVS), which has been so far the applied standard instrument. The new instrument is especially suitable for respondents with low to medium levels of education. Our results validate the postulated Schwartz value theory. A comparison with the SVS supports convergent and discriminant validity of the ten values measured by the PVQ. Statistical relations found between the value types and two external variables support the construct validity of the PVQ. A confirmatory factor analysis does not confirm the postulated number of values, since only nine instead of ten values are empirically identified. An external validation with data from the representative European Social Survey 2003 in Germany and a confirmatory factor analysis (with only 21 items) confirm the Schwartz values scale; however, four value types have to be unified.

This fact and the finding that test length is related to reliability may cause significant misinterpretations of measures when alpha is used as evidence that a measure is unidimensional. For multidimensional measures, use of alpha as the basis for corrections for attenuation causes overestimates of true correlation. Satisfactory levels of alpha depend on test use and interpretation. Even relatively low (e.g., .50) levels of criterion reliability do not seriously attenuate validity coefficients. When reporting intercorrelations among measures that should be discriminable, it is important to present observed correlations, appropriate measures of reliability, and correlations corrected for unreliability.},

This meta-analysis includes 103 studies and N = 12,201 participants. 139 retention and 70 transfer performance measures were used to determine separate mean effect sizes. Cognitive load, motivation/affect, learning time, and eye-tracking data were included as dependent variables to explain possible effect mechanisms. Additionally, nine possible moderators (e.g., type of signaling) were identified. The retention (g+ = 0.53, 95\% CI [0.42, 0.64]) and transfer (g+ = 0.33, 95\% CI [0.22, 0.43]) sizes support the positive effect of signaling on motivation/affect, learning time, and learning-relevant fixations. Cognitive load was significantly reduced. In contrast to the expertise reversal effect hypothesis, prior knowledge was not identified as a moderator of the signaling effect. The results were interpreted using media learning theories. Recommendations for future studies are included herein.},

  abstract = {Abstract This chapter presents an integrated model of text and picture comprehension that takes into account that learners can use multiple sensory modalities combined with different forms of representation. The model encompasses listening comprehension, reading comprehension, visual picture comprehension, and auditory picture comprehension (i.e., sound comprehension). The model's cognitive architecture consists of modality-specific sensory registers, working memory, and long-term memory. Within this architecture, a distinction is made between perception-bound processing of text surface or picture surface structures, on the one hand, and cognitive processing of semantic deep structures, on the other hand. The perception-bound processing of text surface structures includes phonological and graphemic input analyses with graphemic\textendash{}phonemic conversion, leading to lexical patterns. The perception-based processing of picture surface structures includes visual or acoustic nonverbal feature analyses, leading to visuospatial patterns or sound patterns. The cognitive processing includes descriptive processing of lexical patterns (via parsing), which leads to propositional representations, and depictive processing of spatial or sound patterns (via structure mapping), which leads to mental models. Propositional representations and mental models interact via model construction and model inspection processes. After presenting the integrated model of text and picture comprehension, the chapter derives predictions, which can be empirically tested. It reports research findings that can be explained by the model, and it derives practical suggestions for instructional design. Finally, the chapter discusses limitations of the model and points out directions for further research.},

Adults (N = 174) ranging in age from 17 to 71 years old with a mean age of 38 completed the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire (M. Schommer, 1990), which assessed their beliefs in the certainty and organization of knowledge and the speed and control of learning. After they had completed the questionnaire, they responded to a series of questions about two controversial issues that had been discussed in the local newspaper. Regression analyses indicated that the more the participants believed in complex and tentative knowledge, the more likely they were to take on multiple perspectives, be willing to modify their thinking, withhold ultimate deci-sions until all information was available, and acknowledge the complex, tentative nature of everyday issues. Epistemological beliefs that are heavily influenced by a higher level of education appear to relate to thinking beyond the classroom, and introducing controversial issues into the curriculum may reciprocally foster the development of epistemological beliefs.},

One hundred and fifty-two university students completed three questionnaires that assessed their epistemological beliefs about mathematics (hardpure), the social sciences (also pure), and business (neither hard nor pure). Correlations indicated that students' epistemological beliefs were similar for mathematics and social sciences, as well as for mathematics and business. When the amount of academic experience was taken into account, some evidence of domain specificity was found. These results support Sternberg's caveat that the dichotomy of domain generality/ specificity is an assumption that should be questioned. We propose that future researchers should investigate the breadth of applicability of epistemological beliefs.},

The epistemological belief system approach to personal epistemology is distinguished from previous research by the following: (a) the addition of beliefs about learning, (b) the identification of distinct beliefs, (c) the consideration of asynchronous development, (d) the acknowledgment of need for balance, (e) the introduction of belief nomenclature, and (f) the introduction of quantitative assessment. The rationale of these features is discussed. The extended conceptualization of epistemological beliefs as a system within other systems is proposed. Implications for education and future research are also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Twenty undergraduates and four mathematicians were asked to describe their beliefs using analogies and percentages. Comparisons between groups revealed that students were somewhat similar to mathematicians in beliefs about the control and speed of learning, and the source of knowledge. Students were dissimilar to mathematicians in beliefs about the structure, certainty, and justification of knowledge. Students who believed mathematical knowledge is a linear and unchanging, reported using superficial study habits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

In Experiment 1, an epistemological questionnaire was administered to undergraduates. Factor analysis of the questionnaire resulted in 4 factors reflecting degrees of belief in innate ability, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge. In Experiment 2, students read a passage about either the social sciences or the physical sciences, in which the concluding paragraph was removed. Then they rated their confidence in understanding the passage, wrote a conclusion, and completed a mastery test. Belief in quick learning predicted oversimplified conclusions, poor performance on the mastery test, and overconfidence in test performance. Belief in certain knowledge predicted inappro- priately absolute conclusions. This},

  abstract = {Investigators of students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, or epistemological beliefs, have generally assumed that epistemological beliefs are domain independent (i.e., they generalize across domains). The purpose of this research was to test this assumption. College students completed an epistemological questionnaire with a specific domain in mind (either social sciences or mathematics), read a passage (either social sciences or mathematics), answered a passage test, and completed another epistemological questionnaire with the alternative domain in mind. Results support the idea that individuals' epistemological beliefs tend to be domain independent. Mathematical epistemological factors correlated with the corresponding social science epistemological factors. Epistemological beliefs in both domains predicted passage comprehension similarly, and most students showed a consistent level of epistemological sophistication across domains.

Examples are drawn from an architectural design studio and the arts to demonstrate how reflection-in-action can be fostered in students and therefore in professionals in all areas. The approach involves active coaching by a master teacher, including giving students practice facing real problems, testing solutions, making mistakes, seeking help, and refining approaches. Extensive dialogues between teachers and students illustrate how reflection-in-action works, what encourages it, and behavior or attitudes that can prevent the development of reflectiveness.

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called ``co-pilot model,'' and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum effi-ciency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H 1 or H 0 , and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

Schommer's Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire, which does not measure stages or positions of development, but utilizes a Likert-type scale to assess dimensions of epistemological beliefs. Among several recent attempts to refine this type of questionnaire for the assessment of epistemological beliefs, the present authors describe their development and validation of the Epistemic Belief Inventory, modeled on Schommer's questionnaire. Their report may be of particular use to those seeking to understand the construction of such instruments and who wish to compare existing instruments for research purposes. This chapter examines adults' beliefs about the nature and acquisition of knowledge, or epistemic beliefs, and reports on the ongoing validation of the Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI). The EBI is compared to the Epistemological Questionnaire (EQ) developed by Schommer (1990). Findings are discussed with respect to implications for future instrument development.

The chapters focus on a range of conceptual frameworks about how university and field-based experiences influence the connections between teachers' personal epistemologies and teaching practice. In an earlier volume we investigated ways in which we might change preservice teachers' beliefs and teaching practice (Brownlee, Schraw and Berthelsen, 2011). While we addressed the nature of teachers' personal epistemology, learning and teaching practices, and approaches for changing beliefs throughout teacher education programs, the volume did not address conceptual frameworks for the development of teacher's personal epistemologies. The book is focused on teacher educators, teachers and teacher education programmers in universities with an overall aim of highlighting how we might support students to engage in learning that is challenging and to engage in professional experiences that promote changes in teaching practice. We argue that students need to be encouraged to question their beliefs and develop increasingly sophisticated beliefs about their knowledge and their students' knowledge that facilitate learning and intellectual growth"--},

This theory permits more finely tuned characterization of cultures than other theories. It is distinctive in deriving the cultural orientations from a priori theorizing. It also specifies a coherent, integrated system of relations among the orientations, postulating that they are interdependent rather than orthogonal. Analyses of data from 73 countries, using two different instruments, validate the 7 cultural orientations and the structure of interrelations among them. Conceptual and empirical comparisons of these orientations with Inglehart's two dimensions clarify similarities and differences. Using the cultural orientations, I generate a worldwide empirical mapping of 76 national cultures that identifies 7 transnational cultural groupings: West European, English-speaking, Latin American, East European, South Asian, Confucian influenced, and African and Middle Eastern. I briefly discuss distinctive cultural characteristics of these groupings. I then examine examples of socioeconomic, political, and demographic factors that give rise to national differences on the cultural value dimensions, factors that are themselves reciprocally influenced by culture. Finally, I examine consequences of prevailing cultural value orientations for attitudes and behavior (e.g., conventional morality, opposition to immigration, political activism) and argue that culture mediates the effects of major social structural variables on them.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Design: Study 1 examined associations between teacher self-efficacy and cardiac activation on a working day and Study 2 assessed the cortisol morning response in teachers with varying levels of teacher self-efficacy. Main outcome measures: Teacher self-efficacy was assessed by questionnaire. In Study 1 heart rate, heart rate variability, and locomotor activity were recorded by 22 hours ambulatory monitoring and subjective measures of stress and strain were obtained. Study 2 assessed the cortisol response to awakening to obtain a measure of HPA-axis activation and teachers filled in a questionnaire on physical complaints. Results and Conclusion: Study 1 found that self-efficacy proved protective for psychological well-being. Moreover, after controlling for locomotor activity, demographic, and lifestyle variables, self-efficacy was associated with elevated heart rate and attenuated heart rate variability during school and leisure time, respectively, but not during the night, thus questioning the health-implications of self-efficacy. Study 2 found that teachers high in self-efficacy exhibited an attenuated cortisol response to awakening and fewer cardiac complaints. The results of both studies are compatible with the view that teacher self-efficacy might act as a physiological toughening agent with possibly favorable health outcomes.

  abstract = {The extent to which modifications in intermediary metabolism contribute to life history variation and trade-offs is an important but poorly understood aspect of life history evolution. Artificial selection was used to produce replicate genetic stocks of the wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, that were nearly pure-breeding for either the flight-capable (LW[f]) morph, which delays ovarian growth, or the flightless (SW) morph, which exhibits enhanced early-age fecundity. LW(f) lines accumulated substantially more triglyceride, the main flight fuel in Gryllus, compared with SW-selected lines, and enhanced accumulation of triglyceride was strongly associated with reduced ovarian growth. Increased triglyceride accumulation in LW(f) lines resulted from elevated de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and two morph-specific trade-offs: (1) greater proportional utilization of fatty acid for glyceride biosynthesis vs. oxidation, and (2) a greater diversion of fatty acids into triglyceride vs. phospholipid biosynthesis. Even though SW lines produced less total lipid and triglyceride, they produced more phospholipid (important in egg development) than did LW(f) lines. Differences between LW(f) and SW morphs in lipid biosynthesis resulted from substantial alterations in the activities of all studied lipogenic enzymes, a result that is consistent with expectations of Metabolic Control Theory. Finally, application of a juvenile hormone analogue to LW(f) females produced a striking SW phenocopy with respect to all aspects of lipid metabolism studied. Global alterations of lipid metabolism, most likely produced by alterations in endocrine regulation, underlie morph specializations for flight vs. early-age fecundity in G. firmus. Modification of the endocrine control of intermediary metabolism is likely to be an important mechanism by which intermediary metabolism evolves and contributes to life history evolution.},

Compared to past analyses based on the process-product model, a framework based on cognitive models of teaching and learning proved useful in analyzing studies and accounting for variations in effect sizes. Although the effects of teaching on student learning were diverse and complex, they were fairly systematic. The authors found the largest effects for domain-specific components of teaching-teaching most proximal to executive processes of learning. By taking into account research design, the authors further disentangled meta-analytic findings. For example, domain-specific teaching components were mainly studied with quasi-experimental or experimental designs. Finally, correlational survey studies dominated teaching effectiveness studies in the past decade but proved to be more distal from the teaching-learning process. \textcopyright{} 2007 AERA.},

Using video in teacher education can increase pre-service teachers' ability to apply knowledge. However, video is not effective in itself. To be useful, it must be embedded in appropriate instructional contexts. We investigated the differential impact of two university modules---one using video as an illustrative example (rule-example) and one using video as an anchor (example-rule)---on pre-service teachers' (N\textasciitilde{}=\textasciitilde{}56) knowledge. The rule-example group scored higher on reproducing factual knowledge and evaluating videotaped classroom situations, whereas the example-rule group scored higher on lesson planning. The findings emphasize the need for their targeted use depending on specific learning goals.},

(DIPF/Orig.).;;;The author outlines the current, theory-related, status of pedagogical-psychological research on instruction. To that end, she structures the latest research developments along the lines of two different approaches: the paradigm of structure and the paradigm of process. Although teaching and learning are characterized as dynamic and process-oriented in both of these approaches, different research objectives, approaches, methods and paradigmatic interpretations are pursued. The paradigm of structure focuses on clearly definable features of instruction - aggregated over time - that predict learning outcomes. The paradigm of process, on the other hand, focuses on the theoretical modeling of ongoing processes; it specifies how features of instruction are related to one another and how this affects the learning processes. These findings are then, in turn, related to learning outcomes. Both paradigms are currently being integrated in utilization-of-learning-opportunities models. By differentiating between research approaches along the lines of these two paradigms, the contribution aims at providing an analytic framework for novice scholars to help them analyze and interpret empirical pedagogical-psychological studies that often focus on specific aspects of the rather complex utilization-of-learning-opportunities models.

The answers --- informed by philosophy, psychology, and a growing body of casework based on young and experienced practitioners --- go far beyond current reform assumptions and initiatives. The outcome for educational practitioners, scholars, and policymakers is a major redirection in how teaching is to be understood and teachers are to be trained and evaluated.

This definition highlights that CT is primarily a way of thinking and acting, which can be exhibited through the use particular skills, which then can become the basis for performance-based assessments of CT skills. Based on the literature, we categorized CT into six main facets: decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design, debugging, iteration, and generalization. This paper shows examples of CT definitions, interventions, assessments, and models across a variety of disciplines, with a call for more extensive research in this area.},

Until now, evaluations of such systems have provided only little insight into why a particular outcome occurred. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the navigation process (what functionalities are used, and in what sequence) of e-Vita, a PHR for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), to increase the efficiency of the system and improve the long-term adherence. Log data of the first visits in the first 6 weeks after the release of a renewed version of e-Vita were analyzed to identify the usage patterns that emerge when users explore a new application. After receiving the invitation, 28\% of all registered users visited e-Vita. In total, 70 unique usage patterns could be identified. When users visited the education service first, 93\% of all users ended their session. Most users visited either 1 or 5 or more services during their first session, but the distribution of the routes was diffuse. In conclusion, log file analyses can provide valuable prompts for improving the system design of a PHR. In this way, the match between the system and its users and the long-term adherence has the potential to increase. \textcopyright{} 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

Specifically, we make a case that a central challenge in developing students' reasoning is developing their epistemic cognition.

We propose that research in epistemic cognition, motivated reasoning, and conceptual change can help to identify, understand, and address these obstacles for public understanding of science.

This article takes the view that the student teachers' assumptions regarding the concept of theory affect how they engage with theory during initial teacher education. Using a qualitative approach, this study examines student teachers' conceptualizations of the nature and role of theory in teacher education. The results indicate conflicts between student teachers' assumptions about theory in general and pedagogical theories in particular, and also between a narrow conception of the nature of theory and a more nuanced understanding of the purpose of theory. Student teachers' encounter with pedagogy as an academic discipline\textemdash{}with a different epistemology than the one they know from their discipline-specific studies\textemdash{} seems to cause considerable struggle that often ends in a devaluation and denigration of theory in teacher education.

They also examined relations among teacher self-efficacy, perceived collective teacher efficacy, external control (teachers' general beliefs about limitations to what can be achieved through education), strain factors, and teacher burnout. Participants were 244 elementary and middle school teachers. The analysis supported the conceptualization of teacher self-efficacy as a multidimensional construct. They found strong support for 6 separate but correlated dimensions of teacher self-efficacy, which were included in the following subscales: Instruction, Adapting Education to Individual Students' Needs, Motivating Students, Keeping Discipline, Cooperating With Colleagues and Parents, and Coping With Changes and Challenges. They also found support for a strong 2nd-order self-efficacy factor underlying the 6 dimensions. Teacher self-efficacy was conceptually distinguished from perceived collective teacher efficacy and external control. Teacher self-efficacy was strongly related to collective teacher efficacy and teacher burnout. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Participants were 563 Norwegian teachers in elementary school and middle school. Four aspects of teachers' perception of the school context (supervisory support, time pressure, relations to parents, and autonomy) and three dimensions of teacher burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment) were measured. The data were analyzed by means of structural equation modelling using the AMOS 5 program. Teachers' job satisfaction was directly related to two of the dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment) and indirectly related to all aspects of the school context, through emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment. The three dimensions of burnout were differently related to the school context variables. Emotional exhaustion was most strongly related to time pressure whereas depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment were most strongly related to teachers' relations with parents. Implications for both research and educational practices are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student--teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted.

  abstract = {Risk communications are an integral aspect of health education and promotion. However, the commonly used textual risk information is relatively difficult to understand for the average recipient. Consequently, researchers and health promoters have started to focus on so-called decision aids, such as tables and graphs. Although tabular and graphical risk information more effectively communicate risks than textual risk information, the cognitive mechanisms responsible for this enhancement are unclear. This study aimed to examine two possible mechanisms (i.e., cognitive workload and attention). Cognitive workload (mean pupil size and peak pupil dilation) and attention directed to the risk information (viewing time, number of eye fixations, and eye fixation durations) were both measured in a between-subjects experimental design. The results suggest that graphical risk information facilitates comprehension of that information because it attracts and holds attention for a longer period of time than textual risk information. Graphs are thus a valuable asset to risk communication practice for two reasons: first, they tend to attract attention and, second, when attended to, they elicit information extraction with relatively little cognitive effort, and finally result in better comprehension.},

Objective: To determine preferences for different graphical and written risk communication formats, and the delivery of genomic risk information including the mode of communication and the role of health professionals. Design: Focus groups, transcribed and analysed thematically. Participants: Thirty-four participants from the public. Methods: Participants were provided with, and invited to discuss, a hypothetical scenario giving an individual's personalized genomic risk of melanoma displayed in several graphical formats. Results: Participants preferred risk formats that were familiar and easy to understand, such as a 'double pie chart' and '100 person diagram' (pictograph). The 100 person diagram was considered persuasive because it humanized and personalized the risk information. People described the pie chart format as resembling bank data and food (such as cake and pizza). Participants thought that email, web-based platforms and postal mail were viable options for communicating genomic risk information. However, they felt that it was important that a health professional (either a genetic counsellor or 'informed' general practitioner) be available for discussion at the time of receiving the risk information, to minimize potential negative emotional responses and misunderstanding. Face-to-face or telephone delivery was preferred for delivery of high-risk results. Conclusions: These public preferences for communication strategies for genomic risk information will help to guide translation of genome-based knowledge into improved population health.

This important collection of recent articles draws together a wide range of research from as diverse a cross-section of the world as The Netherlands, Cyprus, Australia, the United States, Canada, Norway, and Taiwan to provide an international perspective on teachers' personal epistemology. It is the editors' contention that there has been a lack of focus on how teachers' personal epistemologies relate to their teaching, and even less about teacher education. The articles have been chosen in order to bring together some of the key current arguments about how personal epistemology can be applied to the context of teacher education, foregrounding the links between the way a teacher believes they should teach, the way they actually teach in practice, and\textemdash{}crucially\textemdash{}the impact of these espoused and applied epistemologies on learning. The book addresses four key themes: the nature of teachers' personal epistemologies, the links between these and teaching, between epistemology and learning, and the challenges and realities of changing personal epistemologies through teacher education programmes.

The purpose of this paper is to test the effectiveness of similar techniques in web surveys. Using data from a series of three random sample web surveys of Washington State University undergraduates, we examine the effects of visual and verbal answer-box manipulations (i.e., altering the size of the answer box and including an explanation that answers could exceed the size of the box) and the inclusion of clarifying and motivating introductions in the question stem. We gauge response quality by the amount and type of information contained in responses as well as response time and item nonresponse. The results indicate that increasing the size of the answer box has little effect on early responders to the survey but substantially improved response quality among late responders. Including any sort of explanation or introduction that made response quality and length salient also improved response quality for both early and late responders. In addition to discussing these techniques, we also address the potential of the web survey mode to revitalize the use of open-ended questions in self-administered surveys.

  abstract = {The fact that each student has a different way of learning and processing information has long been recognised by educationalists. In the classroom, the benefits derived from delivering learning content in ways that match the student's learning style have also been identified. As new modes of delivery of learning content such as computer-assisted learning systems (e.g. eLearning) have become increasingly popular, research into these has also identified the benefits of tailoring learning content to learning styles. However, in games-based learning (GBL), the adaptation based on learning style to enhance the educational experience has not been well researched. For the purpose of this research, a game with three game modes has been developed: 1) non-adaptivity mode; 2) a mode that customises the game according to the student's learning style identified by using a learning style questionnaire; and 3) a mode that has an in-game adaptive system that dynamically and continuously adapts its content according to the student's interactions in the game. This paper discusses the term adaptivity in a GBL context and presents the results of an experimental study investigating the differences in learning effectiveness of the different game modes compared to a paper-based learning. The study was performed with 120 Higher Education students learning the database language SQL (Structured Query Language). The results show that the game developed, regardless of mode, produced better learning outcomes than those who learned from a textbook while adaptive GBL was better in terms of allowing learners to complete the tasks faster than the other two game versions.},

Factor analyses of the reference-norm based items yield only two factors, not in accordance with the postulated dimensional structure. One component is made up by the individual reference-norm based items, the other by all remaining items.

  abstract = {"Data use" and "data-based decision making" are increasingly popular mantras in public policy discourses and texts. Policy makers place tremendous faith in the power of data to transform practice, but the fate of policy makers' efforts will depend in great measure on the very practice they hope to move. In most conversations about data use, however, relations between data and practice have been underconceptualized. In this essay, I identify and discuss some conceptual and analytical tools for studying data in practice by drawing on work from various theoretical traditions. I explore some ways in which we might frame a research agenda in order to investigate data in everyday practice in schools. My account is centered on schoolhouse work practice, but the research apparatus I consider can be applied to practice in other organizations in the education sector and indeed to interorganizational practice, a critical consideration in the education sector.

The review is based on the SET meta-validation model, drawing upon research reports published in peer-reviewed journals since 2000. Through the lens of validity, we consider both the more traditional research themes in the field of SET (i.e., the dimensionality debate, the `bias' question, and questionnaire design) and some recent trends in SET research, such as online SET and bias investigations into additional teacher personal characteristics. The review provides a clear idea of the state of the art with regard to research on SET, thus allowing researchers to formulate suggestions for future research. It is argued that SET remains a current yet delicate topic in higher education, as well as in education research. Many stakeholders are not convinced of the usefulness and validity of SET for both formative and summative purposes. Research on SET has thus far failed to provide clear answers to several critical questions concerning the validity of SET.},

One hundred undergraduates read the same medical information purportedly written by either medical experts or laypeople, which was presented as one document or spread across four documents. Results revealed partial support for our hypotheses. Readers of multiple documents exhibited superior memory for conflicts and provided a more balanced description of conflicting information in essays they wrote. Variation of author expertise moderated the effect of presentation format in the essay task but not on the memory test. The results extend previous research by showing that multiple documents reading also stimulates the integration of conflicting information.},

One group of students had to change the anticipated audience perspective between the two sessions, the other group had to consider one single perspective in both ses- sions. Cognitive processes were investigated using a computer-based assess- ment system (CEKOS). The resulting hypertexts were analyzed with regard to the link structure of the documents. Learning effects were measured with five knowledge tests. The results confirm that considering multiple audience per- spectives is an appropriate instruction to deal with the nonlinear structure of hypertexts in a way that promotes knowledge acquisition.},

More specifically, this study investigates: 1) if learners differentiate between tasks of different complexity, and set goals and plan their learning behavior accordingly; and 2) whether such adaptive learning behavior is influenced by their epistemological beliefs. Students (n = 72) inspected a set of six learning tasks and answered multiple questions derived from the COPES-model of self-regulated learning (Winne \{\&\} Hadwin, 1998)--e.g., they judged the importance of specific learning strategies for a particular learning task. Furthermore, they filled in inventories measuring their epistemological beliefs. Results confirmed significant relationships between task complexity and epistemological beliefs on the one hand and students' judgments on the other.

How does learning about someone's inner moral conflict influence children's and adults' moral judgments about that person? Across four studies, we discovered a striking developmental difference: When the outcome is held constant, 3- to 8-year-old children judge someone who does the right thing without experiencing immoral desires to be morally superior to someone who does the right thing through overcoming conflicting desires-but adults have the opposite intuition. This developmental difference also occurs for judgments of immoral actors: Three- to 5-year-olds again prefer the person who is not conflicted, whereas older children and adults judge that someone who struggles with the decision is morally superior. Our findings suggest that children may begin with the view that inner moral conflict is inherently negative, but, with development, come to value the exercise of willpower and self-control.},

  abstract = {Three studies are reported that investigated the relationship between secondary school students' physics-related epistemological beliefs and physics conceptual understanding. Study 1 involved the development of a Greek Epistemological Beliefs Evaluation Instrument for Physics (GEBEP) which was administered to 394 students (10th graders). Study 2 investigated the hypothesis that physics epistemological sophistication as measured by the GEBEP is a good predictor of physics understanding. The participants were selected from the 394 students who participated in Study 1. More specifically we selected the 10\% (38) students with the highest scores in the GEBEP (high epistemological sophistication group, HES) and the 10\% (38) students with the lowest GEBEP scores (low epistemological sophistication group, LES) and measured their understanding of Newton's three laws using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation instrument (FMCE) developed by Thornton and Sokoloff (1998). The results showed that the HES group had significantly higher scores in the FMCE than the LES group. Regression analysis showed that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge and the Structure of physics knowledge were good predictors of physics understanding. Study 3 re-examined the same hypothesis on a new independent sample of students. The results based on the entire sample, showed again that beliefs regarding the Construction and Stability of physics knowledge predicted physics understanding. Overall, the results suggest that sophisticated physics-related epistemological beliefs are necessary but not sufficient for physics understanding and point to the importance of taking them into consideration in physics education.},

In general education, positive effects for CBM were associated with use of class profiles and implementation of peer-assisted learning strategies.

We review the various forms of measurement invariance that have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical, sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in cross-national consumer research. The approach is based on multisample confirmatory factor analysis and clarifies under what conditions meaningful comparisons of construct conceptualizations, construct means, and relationships between constructs are possible. An empirical application dealing with the single-factor construct of consumer ethnocentrism in Belgium, Great Britain, and Greece is provided to illustrate the procedure.},

With BFDA, researchers can control the rate of misleading evidence but, in addition, they can plan for a target strength of evidence. BFDA can be applied to fixed-N and sequential designs. In this tutorial paper, we provide an introduction to BFDA and analyze how the use of informed prior distributions affects the results of the BFDA. We also present a user-friendly web-based BFDA application that allows researchers to conduct BFDAs with ease. Two practical examples highlight how researchers can use a BFDA to plan for informative and efficient research designs.},

Hierarchical regression and relative weights analyses were performed with grades in math and German as dependent variables and intelligence as well as motivational measures as independent variables. Beyond intelligence, different motivational constructs incrementally contributed to the prediction of school achievement. Domain-specific ability self-perceptions and values showed the highest increments whereas achievement motives and goal orientations explained less additional variance. Even when prior achievement was controlled, some motivational concepts still proved to contribute to the prediction of subsequent performance. In the light of these findings, we discuss the importance of motivation in educational contexts. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In a sample of 153 Norwegian upper-secondary school students, topic knowledge was found to be a better predictor of attitudes towards nuclear power plants than was topic interest, whereas topic interest was found to be a better predictor of attitudes towards climate change than was topic knowledge. Thus, more knowledgeable students seemed less likely to be concerned about the potential risk of nuclear power plants than were less knowledgeable students, and more interested and engaged students seemed more likely to judge climate change to be human-induced than were less interested students. Moreover, for both issues, students' interest in the topic and their topic knowledge interacted, with the relationship between interest and attitude depending on students' level of topic knowledge. This interaction differed between the two issues, with a stronger relationship between interest and attitudes observed at lower than at higher levels of knowledge for the nuclear power issue and a stronger relationship between interest and attitudes observed at higher than at lower levels of knowledge for the climate change issue.

Eine erste Operationalisierung dieses Modells mit sieben neu entwickelten Skalen zu {\"U}berzeugungen von Lehrkr{\"a}ften zu inklusiver Bildung wird vorgestellt und an einer Stichprobe von 409 Lehramtsstudierenden in Form von Strukturanalysen, Messinvarianzanalysen und Subgruppenvergleichen empirisch {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. F{\"u}r die sieben operationalisierten Konstrukte von {\"U}berzeugungen zeigte sich, dass sie sich reliabel abbilden lie{\ss}en und Ergebnisse der Faktorenanalysen legten nahe, dass {\"U}berzeugungen zu inklusiver Bildung mehrdimensional zu denken sind. Die Pr{\"u}fung, wie sich die Konstrukte im Anforderungsbereich Intervention faktorenanalytisch abbilden lassen, zeigte - wie f{\"u}r das Gesamtmodell - eine bestm{\"o}gliche Anpassung durch die separate Abbildung der einzelnen Konstrukte; ein gemeinsamer Faktor und damit eine eindimensionale {\"U}berzeugung lie{\ss} sich nicht best{\"a}tigen. Insgesamt wiesen die Mittelwerte der hier befragten Lehramtsstudierenden eher positive {\"U}berzeugungen zur Inklusion auf. Die {\"U}berzeugung, dass mit inklusivem Unterricht ein h{\"o}herer Arbeitsaufwand f{\"u}r die Lehrperson verbunden ist, fand ebenfalls eine hohe Zustimmung. Konfigurale und metrische Messinvarianz konnten f{\"u}r die vorliegenden Subgruppen von Lehramtsstudierenden belegt werden. Es zeigte sich, dass Sonderp{\"a}dagogikstudierende f{\"u}r alle Konstrukte bis auf "Orientierung an internal-stabiler Ursachenzuschreibung" signifikant positivere {\"U}berzeugungen haben als die Studierenden der Regelschullehr{\"a}mter. Masterstudierende unterscheiden sich signifikant von den noch nicht so weit fortgeschrittenen Bachelorstudierenden in jenen {\"U}berzeugungen, die einen weiten Inklusionsbegriff adressieren.

  abstract = {Claims have been made that similar patterns in the development of folk epistemology occur in children, adolescents, and college students. Some researchers claim that children hold absolutistic assumptions about knowledge that evolve into a kind of relativistic framework where personal interpretation is primary, and last into a rationalistic epistemology. Others suggest the same developmental sequence begins in early adolescence or during the college years. The question addressed in this article is how to make sense of these seemingly discrepant claims and the data supporting them. After initially reviewing the alternative models, Fischer's (Psychol. Rev. 87 (1980) 477-531) skill theory is suggested as a framework for understanding the apparent discrepancies that considers both measurement and time of development issues. Fischer and his colleagues distinguish between "functional level" and "optimal level". Functional level is the level at which most people operate without contextual support or practice. It marks the lower end of the development range. He contrasts this to "optimal level" which marks the upper limit of the person's information processing activity. Performance on epistemological tasks may vary between these two levels. Functional and optimal level data from the reflective judgment model (Developing Reflective Judgment: Understanding and Promoting Intellectual Growth and Critical Thinking in Adolescents and Adults, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, 1994) are used to illustrate the different levels of folk epistemology expressed under these two conditions and different ages at which they appear. The importance of using consistent, structural descriptions of epistemological levels across different models is emphasized for comparison purposes and, again, skill theory is suggested as one alternative framework for describing differences in structure across levels and reinterpreting the data on epistemological assumptions in children, adolescents, and college students. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A sample of 157 undergraduates responded to questionnaires on prior knowledge and topic-specific epistemological beliefs before they read the seven texts. After reading, participants were given tasks intended to assess surface and deep understanding, as well as intertextual understanding. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses with the text comprehension measures as dependent variables showed that the belief that knowledge consists of highly interrelated concepts positively predicted scores on all three reading tasks. In addition, beliefs about knowledge as tentative and evolving positively predicted intertextual understanding. Finally, beliefs that the knower is an active constructor of meaning negatively predicted deeper understanding of single texts.

Specifically, students who emphasized that course-related knowledge located on the Internet consisted of specific facts and details perceived Internet-search and evaluation of search results to be less problematic and reported on more help-seeking and use of self-regulatory strategies during Internet-based learning. Moreover, students believing that Internet-based knowledge claims need to be checked against other sources, reason, and prior knowledge were reportedly more likely to use self-regulatory strategies when using the Internet during coursework.

However, the statistical significance of a test as indicated by a p-value does not speak to the practical significance of the study. Thus, reporting effect size to supplement p-value is highly recommended by scholars, journal editors, and academic associations. As a measure of practical significance, effect size quantifies the size of mean differences or strength of associations and directly answers the research questions. Furthermore, a comparison of effect sizes across studies facilitates meta-analytic assessment of the effect size and accumulation of knowledge. In the current comprehensive review, we investigated the most recent effect size reporting and interpreting practices in 1,243 articles published in 14 academic journals from 2005 to 2007. Overall, 49\% of the articles reported effect size\textemdash{}57\% of which interpreted effect size. As an empirical study for the sake of good research methodology in education and psychology, in the present study we provide an illustrative example of reporting and interpreting effect size in a published study. Furthermore, a 7-step guideline for quantitative researchers is also summarized along with some recommended resources on how to understand and interpret effect size.},

However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland \& McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors.

The G-estimation procedure for the proposed RPM represents an extension of the work on direct effects of randomized intervention effects for survival outcomes by Robins and Greenland (1994, Journal of the American Statistical Association 89, 737-749) and on intervention non-adherence by Ten Have et al. (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 8-16). Simulations show good estimation and confidence interval performance by the proposed RPM approach under unmeasured confounding relative to the standard mediation approach, but poor performance under departures from the structural interaction assumptions.

(DIPF/Orig.).;;Ever since the existence of a (largely sociological) theory of professions, the question of the recognition of pedagogues, particularly teachers, as professionals has been controversial. They are usually coded as a deficit-group: as semi-professionals, with a notorious or structural professionalization-deficit, possibly an occupation, rarely a profession, who work with structural deficits without clear technologies - an impossible occupation. The argument is: That such codings are broadly useless, they point to a lack of sensitivity in the profession theory for the pedagogic field, they ignore the achievements of pedagogy and the potential of its technology. Therefore: Profession theory must be adapted so that successful pedagogical activities are not devalued as trivial, but regarded as achievements. It should specify the prerequisites for carrying out the occupation and the chances of improving the quality of pedagogic actions. (DIPF/Orig.).},

Insbesondere die Situation nach dem neuen Lehrerausbildungsgesetz in Nordrhein-Westfalen bringt eine neue Lage, da dort ab 2011 f{\"u}r alle Lehr{\"a}mter ein einheitlich langes Studium von 10 Semestern vorgesehen ist; insofern handelt es sich angesichts der Geschichte der Lehrerbildung in Deutschland um eine historische Z{\"a}sur.

Because CART is the trademarked name of a particular software implementation of these ideas, and tree has been used for the S-plus routines of Clark and Pregibon[2] a di erent acronym | Recursive PARTitioning or rpart | was chosen. The rpart programs build classi cation or regression models of a very general structure using a two stage procedure; the resulting models can be represented as binary trees. The types of endpoints that rpart handles includes classi cations (such as yes/no), continuous values (such as bone mineral density), poisson counts (such as the number of fractures in Medicare patients), and survival information (time to death/last known contact).

However, an integration of the diverse research and literature is still missing. Addressing this issue, we review several hundred articles on interpersonal trust among strangers and integrate them into a coherent framework, explaining trust behavior among unfamiliar agents based on an interaction between situational features and distinct personality characteristics. Understanding trust as a decision under risk, we distill 3 core components of trust behavior from the extant literature: attitudes toward risky prospects (i.e., risk aversion and loss aversion), trustworthiness expectations, and betrayal sensitivity. Each of these refers to a distinct set of causal determinants, including personality characteristics (anxiety/fear, trustworthiness, and forgiveness) which can be localized in the space defined by models of basic personality structure (e.g., the Five-Factor Model and the HEXACO model of personality). In sum, the review contributes to the understanding of trust behavior by linking and integrating the findings from various fields of trust research. Additionally, it provides fruitful directions and implications for future research.},

In this article we conduct a systematic literature review of a large number of published articles in major areas of social science that used propensity scores up until the fall of 2009. We identify common errors in estimation, conditioning, and reporting of propensity score analyses and suggest possible solutions.},

The use of propensity scores in the social sciences is currently experiencing a tremendous increase; however it is far from a commonly used tool. One impediment towards a more wide-spread use of propensity score methods is the reliance on specialized software, because many social scientists still use SPSS as their main analysis tool. The current paper presents an implementation of various propensity score matching methods in SPSS. Specifically the presented SPSS custom dialog allows researchers to specify propensity score methods using the familiar point-and-click interface. The software allows estimation of the propensity score using logistic regression and specifying nearest-neighbor matching with many options, e.g., calipers, region of common support, matching with and without replacement, and matching one to many units. Detailed balance statistics and graphs are produced by the program.},

  abstract = {The Internet is a convenient source of information about science-based topics (e.g., health matters). Whereas experts are familiar with the conventions of ``true'' scientific discourse and the assessment of scientific information, laypeople may have great difficulty choosing among, evaluating, and deciding on the vast amount of information available online on the basis of their fragmentary understanding of science. The evaluation of science-based text informationmay require an (at least rudimentary) understanding of the norms of scientific discourse. Two studies investigated whether laypeople have an adequate grasp of what makes a text scientific and whether their perceptions of text ``scientificness'' contribute to their evaluation of the credibility of online text information. Furthermore, we investigated whether laypeople distinguish between their own judgments of science-based information and those they expect experts to make, indicating a divergence between their understanding of ``official science'' and their personal beliefs.},

Due to their bounded understanding, laypeople rely on the expertise of others and need to identify whether sources are credible. The present study examined under which conditions readers acknowledge and consider available source information. University students read two conflicting scientific claims put forward by sources whose credibility was varied in terms of either expertise or benevolence. They then rated their subjective explanations for the conflicting claims, perceived source credibility, and personal claim agreement. Results showed that when evaluating and explaining the conflict, participants became vigilant to source information specifically when source credibility was questioned. Conflict explanation through differences in sources' competencies mediated the impact of sourcing on source credibility. Information about a source's benevolence revealed a strong direct effect on credibility judgments. However, motivation explanations did not clarify the relationship. Overall, findings show that readers consider source information and apply it adaptively when handling conflicting scientific information.},

In addition, we assessed seekers' awareness of their own knowledge and behavior. Results revealed that users consciously rewarded authors' credentials and subconsciously punished technical language. Seekers were keenly aware of authors' credentials and perceived authors with medical credentials to have a higher level of expertise and their information to be more credible. Technical language use negatively affected authors' integrity and the credibility of their health information, despite seekers being unaware of it.

The data confirm previous observations that cheating is a prevalent behavior among college students and some forms of cheating (e.g., copying homework) occur at greater rates than others (e.g., cheating on exams). The data also support previous observations concerning sex differences and differences in the rates of cheating between larger and smaller institutions. Specifically, men tend to report higher levels of cheating than do women for most forms of cheating. Similarly, students at larger institutions tend to report higher levels of cheating than students at smaller institutions. There were also significant negative correlations between social desirability and rates of cheating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 Tomasik, Berger and Moser. Formative assessments in schools have the potential to improve students' learning outcomes and self-regulation skills; they make learning visible and provide evidence-based guidelines for setting up and pursuing individual learning goals. With the recent introduction of the computer-based formative assessment systems for the educational contexts, there is much hope that such systems will provide teachers and students with valuable information to guide the learning process without taking much time from teaching and learning to spend on generating, evaluating and interpreting assessments. In this paper, we combine the theoretical and applied perspectives by addressing (a) the epistemological aspects of the formative assessment, with an emphasis on data collection, model building, and interpretation; (b) the methodological challenges of providing feedback in the context of instruction in the classroom; and (c) practical requirements for and related challenges of setting up and delivering the assessment system to a large number of students. In the epistemological section, we develop and explicate the interpretive argument of formative assessment and discuss the challenges of obtaining data with high validity. From the methodological perspective, we argue that computer-based formative assessment systems are generally superior to the traditional methods of providing feedback in the classroom, as they better allow supporting inferences of the interpretive argument. In the section on practical requirements, we first introduce an existing computer-based formative assessment system, as a case in point, for discussing related practical challenges. Topics covered in this section comprise the specifications of assessment content, the calibration and maintenance of the item bank, challenges concerning teachers' and students' assessment literacy, as well as ethical and data-protection requirements. We conclude with an outlook on possible future directions for computer-based formative assessment systems and the field in general.},

We identify the operationalization of homework and achievement and the problematic handling of hierarchically ordered data as two important factors affecting the validity of many of the studies performed over the last century. We then describe a new generation of homework studies using multilevel modeling to deal with hierarchically nested data. Finally, we argue that homework research should be more closely connected to well-founded psychological theories of learning and instruction, and we offer three potential links (theories of instruction time, self-regulation theory and expectancy-value theory, and teaching behavior).},

Second, theories with which participants were more familiar were judged less critically.

The instruments used to measure epistemological beliefs in educational psychology (see Duell \& Schommer-Aikins, 2001) typically consist of questionnaires tapping general, decontextualized beliefs about knowledge or knowledge acquisition in a specific field or in general. AIMS: Using specific theories as stimuli, we determine the degree of topic-specificity of certainty beliefs as well as the association between certainty beliefs and the learning environment. SAMPLE: Participants were 662 upper secondary school students (Study 1) and 211 college students (Study 2). METHOD: A global instrument and a topic-specific instrument were used to collect responses to up to 10 stimulus theories. Factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and multi-level modelling were carried out. RESULTS: Students' topic-specific certainty beliefs varied markedly across the stimulus theories. Furthermore, students in different academic environments differed more strongly on global certainty beliefs than on topic-specific certainty beliefs, and global certainty beliefs were only loosely connected to topic-specific certainty beliefs. CONCLUSION: Researchers should critically assess the validity of decontextualized global questionnaires for assessing certainty beliefs.

In this study with a total of 511 students from Grades 8 and 9, an interindividual perspective (focus on between-students differences) was combined with an intraindividual perspective (focus on within-student differences). Multilevel modeling showed that students' homework effort was a function of between-students differences in conscientiousness and within-student differences in perceived homework characteristics (subject-specific quality of tasks and homework control), perceived parental valuation of specific subjects, and homework motivation (subject-specific expectancy and value beliefs). Furthermore, a significant cross-level interaction indicated that perceived homework control by teachers had a stronger effect on students low in conscientiousness than on their more conscientious peers.

The sample consisted of 511 students in Grades 8 and 9. Across all six school subjects, multilevel modelling showed that students' homework motivation and homework effort varied primarily as a function of their shared perceptions of homework quality and control (classroom level) and of their conscientiousness, individual perception of homework quality, and expectancy and value beliefs (student level). Domain-specific patterns were found for student gender in line with gender stereotypes. Cognitive ability, family background, and parental homework help or control were only loosely associated with homework motivation and homework effort. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Through interviewing 37 Taiwanese science teachers, teachers' beliefs about teaching, learning and science were respectively categorized as either 'traditional', or 'process', or 'constructivist'. It was found that most science teachers had 'traditional' beliefs. Moreover, more than a half of the teachers held views about teaching, learning and science that were closely aligned. This study, hence, called these closely aligned beliefs as 'nested epistemologies'. This study also suggested that the 'nested epistemologies' tended to be found in teachers of greater teaching experiences.

This study, by collecting research data from four Taiwanese science teachers, their students, and classroom observations, was carried out to examine the coherences between teachers' SEVs and their (1)teaching beliefs,(2) instructional practices, (3) students' SEVs, and (4) students' perceptions toward actual science learning environments. The findings suggested adequate coherences between teachers' SEVs and their teaching beliefs as well as instructional practices. The teachers with relatively positivist-aligned SEVs tended to draw attention to students' science scores in tests and allocate more instructional time on teacher-directed lectures, tutorial problem practices, or in-class examinations, implying a more passive or rote perspective about learning science. In contrast, teachers with constructivist-oriented SEVs tended to focus on student understanding and application of scientific concepts and they adopted more time on student inquiry activities or interactive discussion. These findings are quite consistent with the results about the coherence between teachers' SEVs and students' perceptions toward science learning environments, suggesting that the constructivist-oriented SEVs appeared to foster the creation of more constructivist-oriented science learning environments. Finally, although this study provided some evidence that teachers' SEVs were likely related to their students' SEVs, the teachers' SEVs and those of their students were not obviously coherent.

The questionnaire responses gathered from 377 high school students in Taiwan were utilized to elicit such relationships. The analysis of the structural equation model revealed that students' absolutist scientific epistemic beliefs led to lower-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as memorizing, preparing for tests, calculating, and practicing) while sophisticated scientific epistemic beliefs might trigger higher-level conceptions of learning science (i.e. learning science as increase of knowledge, applying, and attaining understanding). The students' lower-level conceptions of learning science were also found to negatively associate with their self-efficacy of learning science, while the higher-level conceptions of learning science fostered students' self-efficacy. However, this study found that students who viewed scientific knowledge as uncertain (advanced epistemic belief) tended to possess lower self-efficacy toward learning science.},

Eighty-seven eighth graders were asked to fill out a questionnaire for probing epistemological beliefs (from positivist to constructivist-oriented views) and finished three different types of searching tasks. Their searching process was recorded by screen capture software and answers were reviewed by two expert teachers based on their accuracy, richness and soundness. Five quantitative indicators were used to assess students' searching strategies: number of keywords, visited pages, maximum depth of exploration, refinement of keyword, and number of words used in the first keyword. The main findings derived from this study suggested that, students with richer web experiences could find more correct answers in "close-ended" search tasks. In addition, students with better metacognitive skills such as keyword refinement tended to achieve more successful searching outcomes in such tasks. However, in "open-ended" tasks, where questions were less certain and answers were more elaborated, students who had more advanced epistemological beliefs, concurring with a constructivist view, had better searching outcomes in terms of their soundness and richness. This study has concluded that epistemological beliefs play an influential role in open-ended Internet learning environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

For binary outcomes, communication is relatively straightforward and supported by several statistical tools (e.g., the risk ratio and the number needed to treat [NNT]). For continuous outcomes, the situation is much worse. We discuss several alternatives and propose a new metric, NNTthreshold, that is analogous to the NNT statistic for binary outcomes and that is useful when a clinically meaningful threshold can be identified. Method We use both statistical theory and a statistical simulation to demonstrate how to compute NNTthresholdand to investigate how it behaves. Results NNTthresholdappears to function well, though is slightly conservative in our simulation. Conclusion Study authors need to think carefully about how to discuss study results when outcomes are continuously scaled. NNTthresholdshould be helpful in situations in which a clinically meaningful threshold can be identified.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Prior to and after receiving instruction, teachers completed a CBM graph-comprehension task. They also evaluated the instructional videos. Teachers in the three instructional groups improved more in CBM graph comprehension than control teachers. Improvements were seen primarily in interpreting and linking the data to instruction, two important but difficult aspects of CBM graph comprehension. Differences between the instructional groups were found for interpreting the data. Teachers evaluated the videos positively. Results indicate that teachers' CBM graph comprehension can be improved via video instruction. Implications for teaching teachers to implement CBM are discussed.},

This paper addresses the theoretical differences and similarities amongst three approaches to formative assessment that are currently most frequently discussed in educational research literature: data-based decision making (DBDM), Assessment for Learning (AfL) and diagnostic testing (DT). Furthermore, the differences and similarities in the implementation of each approach were explored. This analysis shows that although differences exist amongst the theoretical underpinnings of DBDM, AfL and DT, the combination of these approaches can create more informed learning environments. The thoughtful integration of the three assessment approaches should lead to more valid formative decisions, if a range of evidence about student learning is used to continuously optimise student learning.},

This study was aimed at investigating changes in 1182 educators' data literacy with regard to student monitoring system data, during a 2-year intervention, which was assessed by using a pretest and posttest. A multivariate multi-level IRT analysis was conducted. The multivariate approach enabled the identification of differences in initial data literacy and development, based on educators' characteristics. Findings showed significant improvements in educators' data literacy. Furthermore, the `knowledge gap' between educators with a master's degree versus higher education was closed, just as the gap between teachers and school leaders.},

Findings show that when teachers invest more than they get back from their school, they report higher levels of emotional exhaustion. As expected, at the interpersonal level, low outcomes from students are related to higher burnout levels; whereas at the organizational level, low investments are related to higher burnout levels. These findings are discussed in terms of the extent to which psychological contact is more intimate or impersonal in both types of relationships.

Studies were coded for their methodological design, the function of the orchestration tool (mirroring, alerting, or advising), the type of information that was provided to the teacher (cognitive or social), and on what level the influence of the tool was evaluated (teacher or student level). It was found that most studies had a descriptive or exploratory design, with small sample sizes. Most orchestration tools fulfilled a mirroring function. There was diversity in the type of information provided. Most included studies focused on the influence of the tool on the teacher, and those studies showed mixed findings on whether the orchestration tool enhanced their practice. Recommendations for future research are provided, and include the need for more systematic development and comparison of the various characteristics of orchestration tools.},

However, the process of how teachers find and interpret relevant information from dashboards, and which help they need during this process, remains largely unexamined. We first describe how we arrived at the design of a prototype teacher dashboard in the context of primary school fraction assignments, based on teacher interviews. We then report an experimental study (n = 53) to investigate the effect of the type of support a teacher dashboard offers (mirroring, alerting, or advising) on teachers' detection and interpretation of potentially problematic situations where intervention might be needed. The results showed that the type of support did not influence detection of events, but did influence teachers' interpretation of a CSCL situation.},

  abstract = {Background: In clinical trials, study designs may focus on assessment of superiority, equivalence, or non-inferiority, of a new medicine or treatment as compared to a control. Typically, evidence in each of these paradigms is quantified with a variant of the null hypothesis significance test. A null hypothesis is assumed (null effect, inferior by a specific amount, inferior by a specific amount and superior by a specific amount, for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence respectively), after which the probabilities of obtaining data more extreme than those observed under these null hypotheses are quantified by p-values. Although ubiquitous in clinical testing, the null hypothesis significance test can lead to a number of difficulties in interpretation of the results of the statistical evidence.
Methods: We advocate quantifying evidence instead by means of Bayes factors and highlight how these can be calculated for different types of research design.
Results: We illustrate Bayes factors in practice with reanalyses of data from existing published studies.
Conclusions: Bayes factors for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence designs allow for explicit quantification of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. They also allow for interim testing without the need to employ explicit corrections for multiple testing.},

Subsequently it will be shown how the Bayes factor can be used to quantify the support in the data for an informative hypothesis (``It is'') and its complement (``It is not''). Subsequently, the performance of the method proposed will be evaluated by means of error probabilities and evaluation of the robustness with respect to violations of the assumption of homogeneous within group variances.

This study is based on the analysis of 252 papers on learning analytics in higher education published between 2012 and 2018. The main research question is: What is the current scientific knowledge about the application of learning analytics in higher education? The focus is on research approaches, methods and the evidence for learning analytics. The evidence was examined in relation to four earlier validated propositions: whether learning analytics i) improve learning outcomes, ii) support learning and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) are used ethically. The results demonstrate that overall there is little evidence that shows improvements in students' learning outcomes (9\%) as well as learning support and teaching (35\%). Similarly, little evidence was found for the third (6\%) and the forth (18\%) proposition. Despite the fact that the identified potential for improving learner practice is high, we cannot currently see much transfer of the suggested potential into higher educational practice over the years. However, the analysis of the existing evidence for learning analytics indicates that there is a shift towards a deeper understanding of students' learning experiences for the last years.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic literature review of the emerging field of visual learning analytics. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze existing approaches, audiences, purposes, contexts, and data sources\textemdash{}both individually and in relation to one another\textemdash{}that designers and researchers have used to visualize educational data. Second, we examine how established literature in the fields of information visualization and education has been used to inform the design of visual learning analytics tools and to discuss research findings. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories. Finally, we present a brief research agenda for the field of visual learning analytics based on the findings of our literature review.},

Based on two longitudinal cohorts (Grades 2 e5; Grades 4e7), latent growth models were used to analyze the development of achievement emotions and coping strategies separately as well as simultaneously. The results show that enjoyment decreases across grades, whereas boredom increases, with substantial changes between Grade 5 and Grade 7. Consistently, the development of enjoyment is positively associated with the development of problem-focused coping and palliative emotion regulation, whereas the development of boredom is positively associated with the development of avoidant coping and anger-related emotion regulation. Moreover, the relation between problem-focused coping and boredom, as well as between avoidant coping and enjoyment, depends on the age group. The results are discussed regarding the organization of learning environments in classes to prevent unfavorable developmental patterns of achievement emotions.},

Although PPK is thought to be an important aspect of teacher quality, it has seen little empirical investigation--largely because no direct and valid measure of PPK has previously been available. Study 1 describes the development of a 39-item measure using multiple-choice items, short-answer items, and video-based items to assess PPK. Experts rated the items to be relevant for teaching and domain general. Study 2 provides further evidence for the measure's validity. Data obtained from 746 German teacher candidates supported the hypothesized nomological network of PPK; the measure was sensitive to differences between groups; and variations in PPK did not overlap to any great extent with variations in discriminant constructs such as general reasoning abilities, personal beliefs, and domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, PPK was positively associated with indicators of instructional quality from the students' perspective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {A female advantage in school marks is a common finding in education research, and it extends to most course subjects (e.g., language, math, science), unlike what is found on achievement tests. However, questions remain concerning the quantification of these gender differences and the identification of relevant moderator variables. The present meta-analysis answered these questions by examining studies that included an evaluation of gender differences in teacher-assigned school marks in elementary, junior/middle, or high school or at the university level (both undergraduate and graduate). The final analysis was based on 502 effect sizes drawn from 369 samples. A multilevel approach to meta-analysis was used to handle the presence of nonindependent effect sizes in the overall sample. This method was complemented with an examination of results in separate subject matters with a mixed-effects meta-analytic model. A small but significant female advantage (mean d = 0.225, 95\% CI [0.201, 0.249]) was demonstrated for the overall sample of effect sizes. Noteworthy findings were that the female advantage was largest for language courses (mean d = 0.374, 95\% CI [0.316, 0.432]) and smallest for math courses (mean d = 0.069, 95\% CI [0.014, 0.124]). Source of marks, nationality, racial composition of samples, and gender composition of samples were significant moderators of effect sizes. Finally, results showed that the magnitude of the female advantage was not affected by year of publication, thereby contradicting claims of a recent ``boy crisis'' in school achievement. The present meta-analysis demonstrated the presence of a stable female advantage in school marks while also identifying critical moderators. Implications for future educational and psychological research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Women?s personal choice of whether to pursue employment or not may create fundamental differences between the group of women who are employed and those who are not employed that standard regression methods cannot account for even after adjusting for confounding. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of propensity score matching (PSM), a technique used widely in econometrics, to address this bias in cross-sectional studies. We use PSM to estimate an unbiased effect-size of women?s employment on their risk of experiencing partner violence in urban and rural Tanzania using data from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Three different measures of women?s employment were analyzed: whether they had engaged in any productive work outside of the home in the past year, whether they received payment in cash for this productive work, and whether their employment was stable. Women who worked outside of the home were significantly different from those who did not. In both urban and rural Tanzania, women?s risk of violence appears higher among women who worked in the past year than among those who did not, even after using PSM to account for underlying differences in these two groups of women. Being paid in cash reversed this effect in rural areas whereas stability of employment reduced this risk in urban centers. The estimated size of effect varied by type of matching estimator, but the direction of the association remained largely consistent. This study?s findings suggest substantial self-selection into employment. PSM methods, by compensating for this bias, appear to be a useful tool for estimating the relationship between women?s employment and partner violence in cross-sectional studies.},

In the psychological literature, the pros and cons of NHST have been, and continue to be, hotly debated The issues that have dominated the NHST discussion in the psychological lit-erature are that (1) NHST tempts the user into confusing the probability of the hypothesis given the data with the probability of the data given the hypothesis; (2) (.05 is an arbitrary criterion for significance; and (3) in real-world applications, the null hypothesis is never exactly true, and will therefore always be rejected as the number of observations grows large. In the statistical literature, the pros and cons of NHST are also the topic of an ongoing dispute (e. A comparison of these two literatures shows that in psychology, the NHST discussion has focused mostly on problems of interpretation, whereas in statistics, the NHST discussion has focused mostly on problems of for-mal construction. The statistical perspective on the prob-lems associated with NHST is therefore fundamentally different from the psychological perspective. In this ar-ticle, the goal is to explain NHST and its problems from a statistical perspective. Many psychologists are oblivious to certain statistical problems associated with NHST, and the examples below show that this ignorance can have im-portant ramifications. In this article, I will show that an NHST p value de-pends on data that were never observed: The p value is a tail-area integral, and this integral is effectively over data that are not observed but only hypothesized. The prob-ability of these hypothesized data depends crucially on the possibly unknown subjective intentions of the researcher who carried out the experiment. If these intentions were to be ignored, a user of NHST could always obtain a sig-nificant result through optional stopping (i.e., analyzing the data as they accumulate and stopping the experiment whenever the p value reaches some desired significance level). In the context of NHST, it is therefore necessary to know the subjective intention with which an experi-ment was carried out. This key requirement is unattain-able in a practical sense, and arguably undesirable in a philosophical sense. In addition, I will review a proof that the NHST p value does not measure statistical evidence. In order for the p value to qualify as a measure of statisti-cal evidence, a minimum requirement is that identical p values convey identical levels of evidence, irrespective},

  abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage\textendash{}Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge.

Only these analyses deserve the label ``confirmatory,'' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid.

Part I of this series outlined several advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing, including the ability to quantify evidence and the ability to monitor and update this evidence as data come in, without the need to know the intention with which the data were collected. Despite these and other practical advantages, Bayesian hypothesis tests are still reported relatively rarely. An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses implemented in Morey and Rouder's BayesFactor package for R. Armed with JASP, the practical advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing are only a mouse click away.},

A large, representative sample of N\textasciitilde{}=\textasciitilde{}6909 ninth grade students from 280 classes was used and a structural model postulating five central dimensions of instructional quality (structure, classroom management, understandableness, motivation, student involvement) was tested by means of a two-level confirmatory factor analysis. The five-factor model adequately described the structure of student ratings. In terms of generalizability, the assumption of equal measurement properties of student ratings across classes held for some of the investigated dimensions (structure and classroom management), but not for others (understandableness, motivation, and student involvement). Possible explanations for these differences are finally discussed.},

One explanation for these low-to-moderate associations is the assumption that teacher and student ratings are not perfectly stable over time. By using a manifest-latent state-trait model, the present study investigated the following topics in a sample of 5th-grade students (74 classes) from vocational track schools: (a) the time consistency of teacher and student instructional quality ratings in math lessons over multiple measurement time points; (b) the agreement among teachers and students for time consistent rating components and single time point ratings; and (c) the predictive power of consistent rating components and single time point ratings with regard to a standardized math achievement test, and math self-concept. Results of multilevel factor analyses with 3 measurement time points over a period of 3 months showed a moderate-to-high time consistency for both teacher and student ratings. Furthermore, the agreement among teacher and student ratings regarding classroom management and goal clarity was higher for the consistent rating components than for ratings at single measurement time points, whereas this pattern was not found for support of autonomy. Finally, student consistent rating components predicted students' pretest adjusted math achievement and self-concept. The effect sizes for ratings at single measurement time points varied within quality dimensions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

In those programs, schools are often used in the first-stage sampling process and students are randomly drawn from selected schools. However, the incidental dependence of students within classrooms, which are not part of the sampling design, may violate assumptions of statistical models, but this nesting also offers the opportunity for educational researchers to evaluate contextual effects. In this manuscript, we utilize the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten dataset to demonstrate impacts of incidental dependence using a two-level model and a three-level model. We then illustrate, through a simulation, that both models can yield unbiased parameter estimates. However, two-level models tend to provide underestimated standard errors for fixed effects at the incidental level, and variance components of the random effect at the incidental level are divided into the flanking levels when it is ignored. In addition, another method of modeling nested data, using generalized estimating equations, was also compared with the model-based methods.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was, first, to provide evidence to support the notion of statistical literacy as a hierarchical construct and, second, to identify levels of this hierarchy across the construct. The study used archived data collected from two large-scale research projects that studied aspects of statistical understanding of over 3000 school students in grades 3 to 9, based on 80 questionnaire items. Rasch analysis was used to explore an hypothesised underlying construct associated with statistical literacy. The analysis supported the hypothesis of a unidimensional construct and suggested six levels of understanding: Idiosyncratic, Informal, Inconsistent, Consistent non- critical, Critical, and Critical mathematical. These levels could be used by teachers and curriculum developers to incorporate appropriate aspects of statistical literacy into the existing curriculum.},

  abstract = {We replicated and extended Shoda, Mischel, and Peake's (1990) famous marshmallow study, which showed strong bivariate correlations between a child's ability to delay gratification just before entering school and both adolescent achievement and socioemotional behaviors. Concentrating on children whose mothers had not completed college, we found that an additional minute waited at age 4 predicted a gain of approximately one tenth of a standard deviation in achievement at age 15. But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.},

Nevertheless, schools may struggle with these mandates because student data are often stored in forms that are difficult to access, manipulate, and interpret. Such access barriers additionally preclude the use of data at the classroom level to inform and impact instruction. Fortunately, there are newly available computer technologies that allow efficient organization and access to student data. In addition to allowing easier accountability reporting, these tools allow user-friendly data access at all educational levels, meaning that teachers can use these tools to engage in the informed reflection necessary to improve classroom practice. In this article, I discuss teacher use of these systems, providing insight into the function of these tools and discussing conditions that make these tools of the most service to teachers.},

  abstract = {Proposes a theory of motivation and emotion in which causal ascriptions play a key role. Evidence is presented indicating that in achievement-related contexts there are a few dominant causal perceptions, and it is suggested that the perceived causes of success and failure share the 3 common properties of locus, stability, and controllability, with intentionality and globality as other possible causal structures. The perceived stability of causes influences changes in expectancy of success; all 3 dimensions of causality affect a variety of common emotional experiences, including anger, gratitude, guilt, hopelessness, pity, pride, and shame. Expectancy and affect, in turn, are presumed to guide motivated behavior. The theory therefore relates the structure of thinking to the dynamics of feeling and action. Analysis of a created motivational episode involving achievement strivings is offered, and numerous empirical observations are examined from this theoretical position. The strength of the empirical evidence and the capability of this theory to address prevalent human emotions are stressed, and examples of research on parole decisions, smoking cessation, and helping behavior are presented to illustrate the generalizability of the theory beyond the achievement-related theoretical focus.

Epistemic construal of the juror task and task-specific competent reasoning was found related to general epistemology, argument skills, and representation of the evidence.

In June 2005, we contacted the corresponding author of every article that appeared in the last two 2004 issues of four major APA journals. Because their articles had been published in APA journals, we were certain that all of the authors had signed the APA Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles, which includes the principle on sharing data for reanalysis. Unfortunately, 6 months later, after writing more than 400 e-mails--and sending some corresponding authors detailed descriptions of our study aims, approvals of our ethical committee, signed assurances not to share data with others, and even our full resumes-we ended up with a meager 38 positive reactions and the actual data sets from 64 studies (25.7\% of the total number of 249 data sets).

This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored. The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements. K},

RID 10722: Argumentation f{\"u}r CFA statt PCA Conducted analyses to demonstrate the differences in population parameters (POPPs) represented by the principle component analysis (PCA) and common factor analysis (CFA) models. The analyses included (1) a replication of the S. C. Snook and R. L. Gorsuch (see record 1989-35232-001) study, using population data instead of simulated sample data and (2) an extension of the Snook and Gorsuch study designed to test their claim that differences in pattern loadings are an inverse function of the number of observed variables in an analysis. In contrast to the findings by W. F. Velicer and D. N. Jackson (see record 1990-27325-001) in this area, the present results suggest that there were systematic differences between POPPs defined by PCA and CFA and that these differences were present even when the correct number of dimensions was retained. Also, the POPPs defined by CFA may have been more generalizable than those defined by PCA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Im Zentrum steht das Konzept des situationalen Interesses, das hoch relevant, aber gleichzeitig empirisch wenig erforscht ist. Der theoretische Teil umfasst die Systematisierung von Bedingungen des situationalen Interesses aus motivations- und unterrichtpsychologischer Sicht. Daran anknupfend werden Befunde einer quantitativen Studie mit 951 Schulerinnen und Schulern im Mathematikunterricht vorgestellt. Anhand von Mehrebenen-Mediationsanalysen wird das funktionale Zusammenspiel motivational-affektiver, kognitiver und instruktionaler Prozessmerkmale sowie ihr Zusammenhang mit dem situationalen Interesse untersucht. Die Befunde ermoglichen methodische und inhaltliche Schlussfolgerungen bezuglich der Erforschung des situationalen Interesses im Unterricht und eroffnen daruber hinaus vielfaltige Anregungen fur die padagogische Praxis.}

It is at the local level, as led by district and school leaders, that edu-cational improvement efforts take root. At the same time, local education leaders face pressure from federal policies to find and use research evidence to inform their decision making. The Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95) calls on leaders to select, adopt, and implement " evidence based " programs and strategies that have demonstrated improved student outcomes or the potential for improved student outcomes. This act follows nearly two decades of federal policy making focused on increasing leaders' opportunities to access and use high-quality research evidence (Haskins \& Margolis, 2015; Haskins, Paxson, \& Brooks-Gunn, 2009). Major initiatives funded by the U.S. Department of Education (e.g., What Works Clearinghouse) likewise aim to support leaders' use of research when making decisions about programs and practices to adopt or design. At present, there is limited information about how often and where local education leaders access research and the purposes for which they use it. A review of studies of school and district leaders' research use indicate that research is dif-ficult for leaders to access, it is rarely used, and it is only sometimes consulted for decision making about program adoption (Coburn, Honig, \& Stein, 2009).

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore UK teachers' use of research-based information, with a particular focus on issues relating to access to information in schools, information literacy, and the role of the school librarian and school library services. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a mixed methodology. In-depth qualitative data gathered through vignette interviews (n=28), group exercises (four groups of between three and five teachers) and a discussion forum were supplemented by quantitative data gathered through surveys of teachers (n=312), head teachers (n=78), school librarians (n=78) and school library services (n=26). Findings - Teachers' professional use of research information reflects a preference for predigested information and informal sources. Although professional bodies and government departments promote the use of research by teachers and provide a range of customised web sites for information, lack of ready local access to information and lack of time were cited as major barriers to the use of research information. Teachers also revealed uncertainties and lack of confidence in their own ability to find and evaluate such information. The findings suggest scope for more targeted provision by school librarians of both information and skills to support the professional development of teachers. However, this raises issues of priorities and resources, and needs to be seen in the context of a wider change in ethos supported by senior management. The study also raises questions about teachers' own experiences and approaches to the use of information in professional learning, and how this might impact on the provision of support for their pupils and the potential for collaborative working between librarians and teachers. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative aspects of the study provided a rich source of data from teachers with varying levels of experience and involvement with the use of research information. However, a low response to the teacher questionnaire survey (10.9 per cent, overall, 312 teachers) resulted in a bias towards more research-oriented teachers in that particular data set. While the data from research-oriented teachers do appear to triangulate, it is difficult to generalise to other teachers. Therefore teacher survey data have been treated with some caution and drawn on only to aid further understanding of the issues raised in interviews and group exercises. Originality/value - In focusing attention on teachers' information behaviour and information literacy, this paper provides a new perspective on the issues affecting the lack of uptake of research evidence within the teaching profession, contributes to the literature on information behaviour and information literacy in professional contexts, and contributes to the understanding of factors which may have a bearing on the development of student information literacy in schools. \textcopyright{} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing.The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.},

As a first step toward examining studying through metacognitive lenses, we present a general typology that delineates facets of academic tasks in general, including studying tasks. Then, we use this typology to characterize four distinguishable but recursively linked stages of studying: task definition, goal setting and planning, enacting study tactics and strategies, and metacognitively adapting studying. Next, we develop connections between our typology for studying and models of metacognitive monitoring, metacognitive control, and self-regulated learning. With this backdrop, we then survey select research that highlights metacognitive activities in each of the four stages of studying. Finally, we summarize our model of studying and offer suggestions for next steps in research on studying as a complex, self-regulated learning event.

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad "lessons learned" for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

  abstract = {Determining sample size requirements for structural equation modeling (SEM) is a challenge often faced by investigators, peer reviewers, and grant writers. Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad "lessons learned" for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

The group structure is defined by the presence of micro observations embedded within contexts (macro observations), and the specification is at both of these levels. At the first (micro) level, the usual logistic regression model is defined for each context. The same regressors are used in each context, but the micro regression coefficients are free to vary over contexts. At the second level, the micro coefficients are treated as functions of macro regressors. An empirical Bayes estimation procedure is proposed for estimating the micro and macro coefficients. Explicit formulas are provided that are computationally feasible for large-scale data analyses; these include an algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance components representing within- and between-macro-equation error variability. The methodology is applied to World Fertility Survey data, with individuals viewed as micro observations and countries as macro observations.},

Our motivating application from e-commerce requires an ES which is appropriate for long-tailed distributions. We review some common ES measures. We then introduce two novel alternative ES for two-sample comparisons, one scale-free and one on the original scale of measurement, and analyse some theoretical properties. We examine these ES for two-sample comparison studies under an assumption of Normality and investigate what happens when both location and scale parameters differ. We explore ES for phenomena for non-Normal situations, using the Weibull family for illustration. Finally, for an application, we assess differences in customer behaviour when browsing E-commerce websites.},

This research (N = 1,476) yielded evidence that it does. People eating from shared plates (i.e., a Chinese-style meal) cooperated more in social dilemmas and negotiations than those eating from separate plates. Specifically, sharing food from a single plate increased perceived coordination among diners, which in turn led them to behave more cooperatively and less competitively toward each other, compared with individuals eating the same food from separate plates. The effect of sharing a plate on cooperation occurred among strangers, which suggests that sharing plates can bring together more than just allies.},

  abstract = {Data in social and behavioral sciences are often hierarchically organized. Multilevel statistical procedures have been developed to analyze such data while taking into account the dependence of observations. When simultaneously evaluating models at all levels, a significant statistic provides no information on the level at which the model is misspecified. Model misspecification can exist at one or several levels simultaneously. When one level is misspecified, the other levels may be affected even when they are correctly specified. Motivated by these observations, we propose to separate a multilevel covariance structure into multiple single-level covariance structure models and to fit these single-level models as in conventional covariance structure analysis. A procedure for segregating the multilevel model into single-level models is developed. Five test statistics for evaluating a model at each level are provided. Standard error formulas for the separate estimators are also provided, and their efficiency is compared to simultaneous estimators. Empirical and Monte Carlo results demonstrate the advantages of the segregated procedure over the simultaneous procedure. Computer programs that will allow the developed procedure to be used in practice are also presented.},

  abstract = {The present contribution discusses the systems question, which has been a topic in pedagogics since the 18th century at the latest and which is still one of its major issues. Based on prior terminological considerations, the author first examines whether systems constructions have undergone a change from subject matter towards knowledge, from world system towards knowledge system. In a second step, he explains the pertinent opinions voiced by different systems critics, dividing them into two categories: subject-oriented and object-oriented arguments. Thirdly, these counterarguments are viewed from a critical-constructive perspective, leading to the conclusion that, although they have to be taken seriously, they do not exclude systems thinking. Based on these considerations, the author, in a final part, inquires into the question of what pedagogics as a system could and should achieve. (DIPF/Orig.).;;Der vorliegende Beitrag besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit der Systemfrage, die sp{\"a}testens seit dem 18. Jahrhundert in der P{\"a}dagogik thematisiert wird und bis heute zu einer ihrer zentralen Fragen geh{\"o}rt. Aufbauend auf terminologischen Vor{\"u}berlegungen wird erstens untersucht, ob Systementw{\"u}rfe eine Wende von der Sache hin zur Erkenntnis, vom Weltsystem hin zum Erkenntnissystem vollzogen haben. Zweitens werden die damit verbundenen Stimmen verschiedener Systemkritiker erl{\"a}utert und in zwei Klassen, einem subjekt-orientierten und einem objekt-orientierten Argument, zusammengefasst. Drittens werden diese Gegenargumente einer kritisch-konstruktiven Betrachtung unterzogen, um den Schluss zu ziehen, dass sie zwar Ernst zu nehmen sind, ein Systemdenken deshalb aber nicht unm{\"o}glich ist. Daran ankn{\"u}pfend wird abschlie{\ss}end der Frage nachgegangen, was eine P{\"a}dagogik als System leisten kann und soll. (DIPF/Orig.).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Online health forums are widely used, but the quality of advice differs as much as the knowledge backgrounds of the audience members who receive the advice. It is important to understand how people judge the information given online. In line with the communication accommodation theory (CAT), online forums represent specific social contexts of communication which can present either accommodative or nonaccommodative language to an audience. Accordingly, use of accommodative or nonaccommodative language might affect people's perceived trust in the communicator. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate how experts who use accommodative (vs nonaccommodative) language are evaluated by passive users of an online forum. METHODS: Participants (n=98) took part in an online experiment and read experts' posts about 10 nutrition myths. Following a 2 x 2 mixed design, experts' posts were written using either low or high amounts of medical technical jargon (MTJ) (within factor) and were directed at different audiences (mainly other medical experts [in a professional forum] vs a user group mainly comprising laypersons [in an advisory forum]) (between factor). Accommodation occurred where experts used high amounts of MTJ to address other medical experts in the professional forum; it also occurred when experts used low amounts of MTJ to address laypersons in the advisory forum. Conversely, nonaccommodation occurred when experts used high amounts of MTJ in the advisory forum and low amounts of MTJ in the professional forum. In each condition, participants evaluated the credibility of the information, the trustworthiness of the experts, and the accommodation by the experts. RESULTS: Overall, participants judged the credibility of information to be higher when experts used MTJ that was accommodative to the designated audience, F1,95=3.10, P=.04, {$\eta$}p2=.031. In addition, participants judged the experts in professional forums to be more trustworthy than experts in advisory forums (all F1,96{$\geq$}3.54, P {$\leq$}.03, {$\eta$}p2{$\geq$}.036). Moreover, participants rated experts who used high amounts of MTJ to have higher competence (F1,96=37.54, P{$<$}.001, {$\eta$}p2=.28], lower integrity (F1,96=10.77, P=.001, {$\eta$}p2=.101), and lower benevolence (F1,96=9.75, P=.002, {$\eta$}p2=.092), as well as to have lower perceived accommodation to the audience (all F1,96{$\geq$}72.17, P{$<$}.001, {$\eta$}p2{$\geq$}.43) compared with experts who used low MTJ. CONCLUSIONS: To provide health information online that is perceived as credible, experts should consider using similar language as the language used by the addressed audience. As it is often impossible to determine the exact makeup of an online audience, further research might investigate whether having experts explicitly declare which audience they intend to address can help people to more reliably assess an expert's trustworthiness. Furthermore, as people assess information differently depending on the context of online communication, it would be valuable for research to consider other aspects of the context beyond those of the audience.},

  abstract = {The policy of performance standards aims for quality improvement in schools by stimulating teachers to plan and organize their teaching according to competence-based performance standards (competence-based teaching) and to use performance data feedback from national standard-based assessments for evidence-based teaching development. The research so far indicates that many teachers seem to make less use of performance standards and data feedback than expected and to use it in partly unintended ways. Cognitive adaption theory suggests that the reaction of individuals to change is strongly influenced by individual characteristics. In particular, self-efficacy, locus of control, and positive affectivity have been found to foster openness to change and therefore enable participation in change. Following this approach, the paper explores to what extent teachers' use of performance standards and data feedback can be linked to individual dispositions such as self-efficacy, perceived control, and positive affectivity. Using data from Austrian primary teachers, the results suggest that self-efficacy and positive affectivity foster openness to the educational standards reform which in turn increases the likelihood of teachers' participation in competence-oriented teaching and data use.},

The difference is a result of the higher cognitive burden placed on the respondent. To study item nonresponse, we manipulate different questionnaire design characteristics, such as the size of the answer box and the inclusion of motivation texts, as well as respondent-specific characteristics, in a randomized web experiment using a student sample. The results show that a motivation text increases the frequency of responses to open-ended questions for both small and large answer boxes. However, large answer boxes earn higher item nonresponse than small answer boxes regardless of the usage of a motivation text. In addition, gender and the respondent's field of study affected the answering of open-ended questions; being a woman or studying social sciences increased the frequency of a response. As the major finding and in contrast to previous findings, our results indicate that particularly large answer boxes should be avoided, because they reduce respondents' willingness to respond.},

  abstract = {Zun{\"a}chst werden allgemeine und {\"u}bergeordnete Aspekte und Theorien der P{\"a}dagogischen Psychologie vorgestellt. Daran anschlie{\ss}end thematisieren die Autoren kognitive sowie motivationale, emotionale und soziale Faktoren in Lernprozessen. Dabei bleiben historische Ans{\"a}tze sowie wissenschaftstheoretische und methodische Aspekte au{\ss}en vor, vielmehr orientieren sich die Beitr{\"a}ge durchg{\"a}ngig an aktuellen Str{\"o}mungen und Theorien innerhalb der P{\"a}dagogischen Psychologie. Das Besondere der Darstellung ist, dass jedes Kapitel mit einem Fallbeispiel eingeleitet wird, anhand dessen dann theoretische Zusammenh{\"a}nge erkl{\"a}rt und praktische Probleml{\"o}sungen diskutiert werden. Ein {\"u}berzeugender didaktischer Ansatz; f{\"u}r Studenten der Psychologie und der P{\"a}dagogik bestens geeignet zur Erg{\"a}nzung der Standard-Lehrb{\"u}cher von Marcus Hasselhorn (ID 43/06) und Gerd Mietzel (zuletzt ID 4/08).
