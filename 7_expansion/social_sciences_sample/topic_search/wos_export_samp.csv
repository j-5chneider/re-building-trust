These pathways were tested through analyses of the relationships between feedback provided and received, feedback implemented and overall revisions, and improved writing quality in a new article. Overall, the number of revisions predicted growth in writing ability, and both amount of received and provided feedback were associated with being more likely to make revisions.

We apply models of commuting stress developed for adult commuters to students in an open enrollment school district to examine whether commuting difficulty plays a part in school absence. By comparing residentially stable students with themselves as they transition from eighth to ninth grade, we identify how changes in estimated school transportation are related to changes in attendance.

Across the globe, educational changes are seen as fundamental to the creation of peaceful, tolerant, and democratic civic identities, the key to social reconstruction, a better future, and a lasting peace. Drawing on qualitative data from varied schools in postwar Guatemala, this article illustrates a critical dilemma in post-conflict civic education: the difficulties of engaging directly with past and present injustice while moving toward a shared national identity. Global models of democratic, multicultural, and human rights education alone are inadequate for creating a new sense of citizenship in a country in which young people's sense of belonging and their interpretations of the past are deeply connected to how their communities are positioned within a profoundly inequitable power structure.";"[Rubin, Beth C.] Rutgers State Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Educ, 10 Seminary Pl, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA";"Rubin, BC (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Educ, 10 Seminary Pl, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.";"beth.rubin@gse.rutgers.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;76;8;10;1;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0002-8312";"1935-1011";NA;"AM EDUC RES J";"Am.

Structural equation modeling confirmed significant associations between experiences in teacher education and discomfort with student diversity, endorsement of mastery- and performance-oriented practices, and reluctance to adjust instruction to culturally diverse student needs. The number of multicultural education courses completed negatively predicted preservice teachers' stereotype beliefs and positively predicted mastery orientation. Reluctance to accommodate to culturally diverse students' educational needs mediated relations between stereotype beliefs and discomfort with student diversity with mastery- and performance-oriented practices.

Widespread arguments against the proposed change emphasized the identification of highly successful students as worthy and others as unworthy of resources. Through an analysis of print and digital public texts, we identify a narrative cycle that informed public debate: (a) colorblind rhetoric, (b) academic performance is presumed to emerge solely from talent and effort, so (c) academic performance then becomes a measure of worth, and finally, (d) efforts to address racial disparities are unfair.

Our findings suggest a predominance of cultural brokering consistent with programmatic goals to socialize nondominant families into school-centric norms and agendas.

However, the suspension gap between Black and White students persisted. Implications for reform in school discipline practices are noted.";"[Anyon, Yolanda] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, 2148 S High St, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Gregory, Anne] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Stone, Susan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Farrar, Jordan] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Jenson, Jeffrey M.] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, Children & Youth Risk, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [McQueen, Jeanette] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, Online MSW Program, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Downing, Barbara] Denver Publ Sch, Off Social Emot Learning, Denver, CO USA; [Greer, Eldridge] Denver Publ Sch, Student Equ & Opportun, Denver, CO USA; [Simmons, John] Denver Publ Sch, Div Student Serv, Denver, CO USA";"Anyon, Y (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, 2148 S High St, Denver, CO 80208 USA.";"yanyon@du.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;86;24;24;1;35;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0002-8312";"1935-1011";NA;"AM EDUC RES J";"Am.

Charter schools exhibited higher perceived school safety than traditional public schools. However, controls for student commute distance and parental involvement largely diminished this difference.

Using data on school resource needs, sociometric measures, and a set of multilevel logit models, the results of a study of 211 New York City public high schools and 1,098 partner organizations from 1999 to 2005 suggest that high schools have unequal access to partner resources. Already well-endowed schools, in terms of having many experienced teachers or being embedded in dense networks, are most likely to partner. Disadvantaged schools, in terms of having many low socioeconomic status students or being in high-competition network positions, are least likely to partner.

Instead, strong principals may seek to strategically influence the composition of their school's teaching force by retaining high performers and not retaining lower performers. We investigate such strategic retention behaviors with longitudinal data from Tennessee. Using multiple measures of teacher and principal effectiveness, we document that indeed more effective principals see lower rates of teacher turnover, on average. Moreover, this lower turnover is concentrated among high-performing teachers. In contrast, turnover rates of the lowest-performing teachers, as measured by classroom observation scores, increase substantially under higher-rated principals.

Noting dissonances and ambivalences in the students' responses, the conceptual resources of figured worlds enable an analysis of the interplay of discourses, interactions, sensory experiences, and material artifacts as civic identities are constituted. The two students' differing responses are analyzed in relation to other figured worlds that students and teachers daily negotiate: of compliant citizenship, productive citizenship, and consumer citizenship.

This study fills this research void by examining whether full-day kindergarten participation predicts differences in achievement and social-emotional outcomes for children with disabilities. Using a national data set of kindergarten students from the 2010-2011 school year (ECLS-K:2011) and employing propensity matching, this study finds that relative to part-day kindergarten (PDK), full-day kindergarten (FDK) attendance is associated with higher achievement scores but also with higher frequencies of internalizing behaviors and lower incidences of self-control at the end of the kindergarten school year. The relationships between FDK attendance and outcomes varied by type of disability classification, such that significant achievement effects emerged only for children with learning and communication disorders. In addition, less time spent on child-initiated activities was associated with higher mathematics scores for children in FDK programs but not for children in PDK programs.

Although all the students expressed high aspirations, those from a middle-class background were more likely to view academic performance in individualistic terms than their working- and lower-class peers, who were more critical of meritocracy.

Using factor analysis, we construct measures of four distinct dimensions of school climate captured on the annual NYC School Survey. We identify credible estimates by isolating variation in organizational contexts within schools over time. We find that improvements in school leadership especially, as well as in academic expectations, teacher relationships, and school safety are all independently associated with corresponding reductions in teacher turnover. Increases in school safety and academic expectations also correspond with student achievement gains. These results are robust to a range of threats to validity suggesting that our findings are consistent with an underlying causal relationship.";"[Kraft, Matthew A.] Brown Univ, Educ & Econ, Box 1938, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Marinell, William H.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Res, Analyt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yee, Darrick Shen-Wei] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA";"Kraft, MA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Educ & Econ, Box 1938, Providence, RI 02912 USA.";"mkraft@brown.edu";NA;NA;"William T.

However, preK significantly improved third-grade reading achievement for children living in high-poverty neighborhoods. The treatment effects on reading achievement were substantial: Among children living in high-poverty neighborhoods, those who took up an experimental assignment to attend preK scored over half a standard deviation higher on average than the control group in third grade. In contrast, preK enrollment had, if anything, a negative effect on third-grade reading achievement among children living in low-poverty neighborhoods.

Results show that teachers base their decisions on rational processes only to a limited extent.

Their discourse addressing race, intersectionality, and equity disrupts colorblind ideology. Connecting our analysis to the current social landscape, we argue intersectionality offers a framework for engaging politics of accountability.

In addition, analyses of scores from two observation instruments, as well as qualitative viewing of lesson videos, identified stark differences in instructional practices across districts among teachers who received similar within-district value-added rankings.

Using rich, longitudinal data, we estimate the effects of residential mobility on the performance of New York City public school students. Using both student fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches, we find that long-distance moves have negative effects, while short-distance moves improve student performance. These differential effects are partially, but not fully, explained by school mobility. Rather, the positive effects of short-distance moves may be explained by improvements in housing, while the negative impacts of long-distance moves may be explained by lower performance relative to school peers and loss of social capital.";"[Cordes, Sarah A.] Temple Univ, Policy Org & Leadership Studies, Coll Educ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 228, Philadelphia, PA 19123 USA; [Schwartz, Amy Ellen] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Stiefel, Leanna] NYU, Steinhardt & Wagner Sch, Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA";"Cordes, SA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Policy Org & Leadership Studies, Coll Educ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 228, Philadelphia, PA 19123 USA.";"sarah.cordes@temple.edu";NA;"Cordes, Sarah/0000-0003-4355-0806";NA;NA;NA;40;1;1;1;3;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0002-8312";"1935-1011";NA;"AM EDUC RES J";"Am.

To address these gaps, we use extensive qualitative data to analyze change in Los Angeles, Denver, and New Orleans. Drawing on evolutionary theories, we find that external crises, state policy, and new actors triggered change, yet distinct contexts and change processes resulted in markedly different systems.

Drawing on an ethnographic study of Homeward Bound (pseudonym), a program for Vietnamese youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we show how immigrant youth organizing functions as civic preparation. We identify three processes. Organizing has the potential to (a) develop the critical orientation of immigrant youth participants and prepare them to (b) navigate the unique political dynamics within their local communities and (c) work cooperatively and productively with other communities.

Students' self-concept, teacher-rated effort, and achievement in mathematics were promoted through the quotations condition, partly in the long term.";"[Brisson, Brigitte Maria; Gaspard, Hanna; Haefner, Isabelle; Flunger, Barbara] Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Tubingen, Germany; [Dicke, Anna-Lena] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, Irvine, CA USA; [Nagengast, Benjamin] Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Educ Psychol, Tubingen, Germany; [Trautwein, Ulrich] Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Educ Sci, Tubingen, Germany";"Brisson, BM (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Tubingen, Germany.";"Brigitte.Brisson@dipf.de";"Trautwein, Ulrich/C-3064-2011";"Trautwein, Ulrich/0000-0003-0647-0057; Gaspard, Hanna/0000-0001-8830-8031";"German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [TR 553/7-1]; Ministry of Science, Research, and the Arts in Baden-Wurttemberg; Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments [GSC 1028]";"This research was funded in part by German Research Foundation Grant TR 553/7-1 awarded to Ulrich Trautwein, Oliver Ludtke, and Benjamin Nagengast.

Using administrative data from Tennessee, we explore whether evaluation reforms differentially influenced mobility patterns for teachers of varying effectiveness. We find that the rollout of a statewide evaluation system, even without punitive consequences, was associated with increased turnover; however, there was comparably greater retention of more effective teachers, with larger differences in turnover between highly and minimally effective teachers confined to urban districts and low-performing schools. These results imply that states and districts can increase exit rates of low-performing instructors in the absence of automatic dismissals, which is a pattern that our analyses suggest may not generalize beyond urban school settings.";"[Rodriguez, Luis A.] NYU, Educ Leadership, 82 Washington Sq East, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Swain, Walker A.] Univ Georgia, Educ Adm & Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Springer, Matthew G.] Univ N Carolina, Educ Reform, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA";"Rodriguez, LA (corresponding author), NYU, Educ Leadership, 82 Washington Sq East, New York, NY 10003 USA.";"luis.a.rodriguez@nyu.edu";NA;"Rodriguez, Luis/0000-0002-4877-2056; Springer, Matthew/0000-0001-9759-0999";NA;NA;NA;53;0;0;7;7;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0002-8312";"1935-1011";NA;"AM EDUC RES J";"Am.

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one's prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education.

Despite concerns that community college baccalaureate (CCB) programs will duplicate efforts and cut into the market share of nearby 4-year institutions, extant literature has yet to examine the impact of CCB adoption on bachelor's degree program enrollment and bachelor's degree production at 4-year institutions. Using program-level data, our findings show that local CCB degree programs have a negative effect on overall bachelor's degree enrollment and bachelor's degree production at 4-year institutions, but this effect is concentrated primarily within for-profit 4-year institutions.

This has been partly due to new technologies displacing writing as a predominant resource for learning, prompting new sense-making practices and shifts in how these changes are theorized. Learners now routinely collaborate to generate, manipulate, analyze, and share images in many subject areas, where multimodal and multimedia resources are expected to motivate learners, enact new learning processes and outcomes, and display this cross-modal learning. These new practices have prompted revisions to how writing is understood and used as a tool for learning in an increasingly multimodal, highly digitized world. In reviewing this literature, we claim that there are strong evidence-based reasons for viewing writing as a central but not sole resource for learning. Our case draws on both past and current research on writing as an epistemological tool. In presenting this case, we draw primarily on our professional background in science education research, acknowledging its distinctive take on the use of writing for learning.

Drawing on neoinstitutional theory, this paper examines the missions, infrastructure, activities, and outcomes related to civic engagement across postsecondary institutional characteristics. By combining several data sources on a diverse set of institutions, we empirically demonstrate institutional isomorphism with respect to civic engagement mission and decoupling of mission from infrastructure and activities. Our most striking finding is that a residential student population is strongly associated with an increased emphasis on civic engagement even after controlling for institutional control, selectivity, research funding, and student services spending. Given the growing number of students attending nonresidential institutions, this finding has important implications for whether higher education is an effective instrument for preparing civically engaged citizens in our society.";"[Evans, Brent J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Publ Policy & Higher Educ, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Peabody Coll, PMB 414,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Marsicano, Christopher R.] Davidson Coll, Educ Studies Dept, Box 7124, Davidson, NC 28035 USA; [Lennartz, Courtney J.] Univ Maryland, Higher Educ Program, Dept Counseling Higher Educ & Special Educ, Benjamin Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";"Evans, BJ (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Publ Policy & Higher Educ, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Peabody Coll, PMB 414,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.";"b.evans@vanderbilt.edu; chmarsicano@davidson.edu; clennart@umd.edu";NA;"Marsicano, Christopher/0000-0001-5855-2949";NA;NA;NA;75;3;3;0;10;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

These benchmarks also fail to consider important differences in study features, program costs, and scalability. In this article, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences.

Much of the debate centers on the merits and demerits of these initiatives and the general approach they represent to reforming teaching and learning. In this article, we focus on a different issue, that is, the opportunity to advance research on policy implementation afforded by the intertwined nature of CCSS and accountability efforts. Arguing that it is essential for stakeholders, regardless of their stance on either reform, to understand whether and how both influence classroom teaching and learning, we outline elements of a research agenda to generate knowledge important to the design of future instructional policies. For this to happen, we argue that an implementation research agenda needs to build on (rather than reinvent) lessons learned from the past quarter century of implementation scholarship on instructional policy.

The survey was then administered to capture the characteristics of children, teachers, and administrators within the center. These data reveal three key results. First, we find robust evidence of discrimination: Black and Hispanic applicants receive significantly fewer interview requests than observationally equivalent Whites. Second, our results are consistent with a model of customer discrimination: The racial and ethnic composition of the center's customer base is correlated with the characteristics of job seekers receiving an interview.

For this reason, such measurement practice systematically underestimates the potential of students from nondominant socioeconomic or ethnic groups, who may not have had adequate opportunity to develop various academic skills but can nonetheless do so in the future. One long-standing approach to the partial rectification of this issue is dynamic assessment (DA), a technique that features multiple testing occasions integrated with learning opportunities. However, DA is extremely resource intensive to incorporate into educational assessment practice and cannot be applied to extant large-scale data sets. In this article, the authors describe a recently developed statistical technique, dynamic measurement modeling (DMM), which is capable of estimating quantities associated with DAincluding student capacity for learning a particular skillfrom existing large-scale longitudinal assessment data, allowing the core concepts of DA to be scaled up for use with secondary data sets such as those collected by Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems in the United States. The authors show that by considering several assessments over time, student capacity can be reliably estimated, and these capacity estimates are much less affected by student race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status than are single-timepoint assessment scores, thereby improving the consequential validity of measurement.";"[Dumas, Denis G.] Howard Univ, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Dumas, Denis G.] Univ Denver, Morgridge Coll Educ, 1999 East Evans Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [McNeish, Daniel M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [McNeish, Daniel M.] Arizona State Univ, Quantitat Psychol, Dept Psychol, POB 871104, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA";"Dumas, DG (corresponding author), Howard Univ, Washington, DC 20059 USA.; Dumas, DG (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Morgridge Coll Educ, 1999 East Evans Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA.";"denis.dumas@du.edu; dmcneish@asu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;62;8;8;0;24;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

The research team collected and analyzed longitudinal data (surveys, interviews, observations) in high schools located in conservative, liberal, and centrist communities within one swing state. Findings indicate that students' political interest increased during the election. These increases were related to greater public attention to politics and having opportunities to explore multiple sides of political issues and express political opinions. When guiding such experiences, some teachers struggled with various challenges, including one-sided political environments and students' political cynicism.

Snyder, a federal class action lawsuit originally filed in September 2016, is one of the most recent and high-profile entrants into the line of cases involving large-scale education reform. In this case, seven students from traditional public schools and charter schools in Detroit sued various Michigan state officials, arguing that the U.S. Constitution includes a fundamental right of access to literacy and that the state had denied them this right. Although the federal trial court in Detroit that initially heard the case found that students were not denied their right of access to literacy by the state, the plaintiffs appealed the case, and it is now being considered in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Given the difficulties that have historically emerged with court-driven education reform, we examine the opportunities and challenges inherent in Gary B. to provide insight into the prospects of Gary B. and similar cases to effectively promote educational improvement. Grounded in this examination, we also present an argument for the utility of a new model for education litigation. We specifically argue that courts acting as agenda setters and working in concert with stakeholders to tailor reform to ground-level conditions is a model that is highly compatible with contemporary education research on effective models of systemic improvement. A court-mandated agenda for educational improvement must be structured in a way that engages stakeholder groups in implementation efforts precisely because improvement naturally involves dynamic, contextual conditions that cannot be completely accounted for in advance.";"[Superfine, Benjamin Michael; Richard, Meagan S.] Univ Illinois, Educ Policy Studies, 1040 W Harrison, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Goldman, Susan R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Liberal Arts & Sci, 1240 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Goldman, Susan R.] Univ Illinois, Learning Sci Res Inst, 1240 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA";"Superfine, BM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Educ Policy Studies, 1040 W Harrison, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.";"bsuperfi@uic.edu; sgoldman@uic.edu; mricha44@uic.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;28;1;1;0;0;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

They are at increased risk of victimization and abuse and face stigmatization for being both homeless and a sexual or gender minority. These youth are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to become homeless after being forced out of their homes. Because of this, it is important to consider the wide array of backgrounds and identities of LGBT homeless youth when studying their lived experiences and creating public policies and tools to help them succeed.

Using roughly 8 million fourth- and eighth-grade students' scores on state assessments, we estimate state- and district-level math and reading male-female achievement gaps. We find that the estimated gaps are strongly associated with the proportions of the test scores based on multiple-choice and constructed-response questions on state accountability tests, even when controlling for gender achievement gaps as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) or Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments, which have the same item format across states.

Based on a cohort-by-cohort comparative analysis, we find that cohorts after the reform are more likely to enroll and pass introductory college-level courses in their 1st year of college, indicating that the reform may help to accelerate student success in college.

Essentially, these methods rely on impact evaluations, that is, research studies of efficacy and effectiveness. However, in most research in education, these cost and impact evaluations are performed separately. This separation creates methodological deficiencies and undermines the contribution of educational research to decision making. In this article, we identify key domains of educational research evaluations that, we believe, would be enhanced if resource and cost analyses were integrated more directly. These domains relate to outcome specification, treatment contrast, implementation fidelity, the role of mediators, power of the test, and meta-analysis. For each domain, we provide a case study example of how these cost analyses can complement and augment current research practices in educational evaluation. More interaction between economists and education researchers would be beneficial for both groups.";"[Belfield, Clive R.] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ, 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Bowden, A.

However, there is little understanding of the geographic flow of these funding patterns and the market, policy, and organizational conditions that have concentrated funding in some clusters of states more than others. To address this limitation, we use descriptive cartography and quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression to analyze longitudinal funding data from 15 philanthropic foundations along with data related to the contexts of the states where grant recipients reside. We find that between 2009 and 2014, foundations were increasingly converging their funding flows to charter school organizations in select clusters of states as they shifted the concentration of funds away from individual charter schools to charter management organizations (CMOs) and advocacy organizations. A substantial portion of the variation in this interstate convergent grant funding was associated with previously established funding flows. However, the local market and policy contexts of states and certain forms of evidence of charter school effectiveness were also associated with interstate convergent funding. These findings point to the potential ways public policy and research can shape the flow of private money into public education and yet illuminate substantial geographic inequality in the ways these funds are distributed.";"[Ferrare, Joseph J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Educ Policy Studies & Evaluat, 597 S Upper St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Ferrare, Joseph J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Sociol, 597 S Upper St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Ferrare, Joseph J.] Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 597 S Upper St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Setari, R.

In this conceptual essay, we outline a typology of teacher turnover measures, discussing both measures used in existing teacher turnover literature as well as new measures that we have developed. We illustrate each of the measures using 10 years of administrative data from Texas. We discuss how the measures can help illuminate different ways in which staff instability can affect schools and identify schools that suffer from particularly severe staffing issues. We conclude with implications for policymakers and researchers who may seek to apply these measures to future empirical studies.";"[Holme, Jennifer Jellison; Jabbar, Huriya; Germain, Emily] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, 1912 Speedway D5400,George I Sanchez Bldg, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dinning, John] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA";"Holme, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, 1912 Speedway D5400,George I Sanchez Bldg, Austin, TX 78712 USA.";"jholme@austin.utexas.edu; jabbar@austin.utexas.edu; ekgermain@austin.utexas.edu; johnbdinning@gmail.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;46;9;9;1;15;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

The discussion shows how these addresses both reflected the progress and challenges of research on teaching and teacher education at the times they were delivered and identified paths that the education research community could take to address the challenges. It traces key influences of these lines of work on the quality of teacher preparation, assessment of teaching effectiveness, and competing conceptions of teacher accountability. It ends with a discussion of the role of politics in setting educational policy, a call for education researchers to become more knowledgeable about and more capable of engaging in political and policy arenas productively, and a reminder that public scholarship is the goal of the 2016 AERA Annual Meeting and the topic of the next presidential address.";"[Darling-Hammond, Linda] Stanford Univ, Educ Emeritus, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";"Darling-Hammond, L (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Educ Emeritus, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";"ldh@stanford.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;69;51;54;1;35;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

This essay highlights that many of the core claims about grit have either been unexamined or are directly contradicted by the accumulated empirical evidence. Specifically, there appears to be no reason to accept the combination of perseverance and passion for long-term goals into a single grit construct, nor is there any support for the claim that grit is a particularly good predictor of success and performance in an educational setting or that grit is likely to be responsive to interventions. I describe avenues for future research on grit that may help to clarify if grit can contribute to our understanding of success and performance. These avenues include examinations of possible configural relationships between passion and perseverance, whether grit or grit facets represent necessary but not sufficient conditions for performance, interactions between ability and either grit or the facets of grit in the prediction of performance, possible polynomial relationships between grit or grit facets and performance, and improvements in the manner in which grit is assessed. Alternative predictors of performance that are more strongly related to success and performance and that may be more responsive to interventions are also discussed.";"[Crede, Marcus] Iowa State Univ, Dept Psychol, W112 Lagomarcino Hall,901 Stange Rd, Ames, IA 50011 USA";"Crede, M (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Psychol, W112 Lagomarcino Hall,901 Stange Rd, Ames, IA 50011 USA.";"mcrede@iastate.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;39;18;18;7;25;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

Nevertheless, in this respect there has been little research on school-based extracurricular groups focused on issues of social inclusion and justice. An exception to this lack of focus has been Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs), which promote social inclusion and justice for sexual and gender minority youth (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth; LGBTQ) through support, socializing, education, and advocacy. As this literature has matured, we detail and provide examples of the following conceptual and methodological recommendations to address emerging research needs for GSAs: (1) Move from a monolithic to contextualized treatment of GSAs, (2) attend to heterogeneity among members, (3) utilize multiple data sources for triangulation, (4) apply a range of methodological approaches to capitalize on strengths of different designs, (5) collect longitudinal data over short-term and extended time periods, and (6) consider GSAs within a broader umbrella of youth settings. Further, we note ways in which these recommendations apply to other student groups organized around specific sociocultural identities. These advances could produce more comprehensive empirically supported models to guide GSAs and similar groups on how to promote resilience among their diverse members and address broader social issues within their schools.";"[Poteat, V.

To disentangle these factors, in a randomized controlled study (N = 390), we examined teachers' evaluations of 18 mathematical solutions to which gender- and race-specific names had been randomly assigned. Teachers displayed no detectable bias when assessing the correctness of students' solutions; however, when assessing students' mathematical ability, biases against Black, Hispanic, and female students were revealed, with biases largest against Black and Hispanic girls. Specifically, non-White teachers' estimations of students' mathematical ability favored White students (both boys and girls) over students of color, whereas (primarily female) White teachers' estimations of students' mathematical ability favored boys over girls.

Over time, reauthorization of this legislation has highlighted the importance of educating SWDs in the general education environment where appropriate, and significant interaction with general education peers who are not receiving special education services (GENs) has followed. The largest U.S. school district-New York City (NYC), the setting of our study-mirrors this national trend toward more inclusive environments. Despite the trend, a critical question remains: Does inclusion in fact feel inclusive? This study provides a district-wide descriptive analysis of feelings of inclusion among SWDs compared to their GEN peers. We rely on detailed, longitudinal administrative and student survey data on approximately 249,000 NYC middle school students attending schools that educate both SWDs and GENs (which we call traditional schools in contrast with schools that educate only SWDs). Our results suggest that while gaps between SWDs overall and GENs are quite small, there is some heterogeneity. Specifically, students with an emotional disturbance (ED) and other health impairments (OH) feel modestly less included with peers but more with adults. There are, however, almost no differences in feelings of inclusion between students assigned exclusive and inclusive services, even for those in the ED and OH groups. In fact, for students with low incidence (LI) disabilities, feelings of inclusion are slightly better when assigned exclusive services.";"[Stiefel, Leanna] NYU, Wagner Sch, Econ & Educ Policy, 295 Lafayette St,3098, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Stiefel, Leanna] NYU, Steinhardt Sch, Econ & Educ Policy, 295 Lafayette St,3098, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Shiferaw, Menbere] NYU, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, Doctoral Program Publ Policy, 295 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Schwartz, Amy Ellen] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Publ Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Gottfried, Michael] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Gevirtz Grad Sch Educ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";"Stiefel, L (corresponding author), NYU, Wagner Sch, Econ & Educ Policy, 295 Lafayette St,3098, New York, NY 10012 USA.; Stiefel, L (corresponding author), NYU, Steinhardt Sch, Econ & Educ Policy, 295 Lafayette St,3098, New York, NY 10012 USA.";"leanna.stiefel@nyu.edu; menbere.shiferaw@nyu.edu; amyschwartz@syr.edu; mgottfried@education.ucsb.edu";"Stiefel, Leanna/K-9392-2019";NA;"Spencer Foundation";"We thank Clive Belfield, Bryant Hopkins, Agustina Laurito, anonymous referees, participants at the 2015 Association for Public Policy and Management and the 2016 Association for Education Finance and Policy conferences, and participants at the NYU-IESP summer seminar series for helpful comments.

However, the impact of paywalls on the consumption of academic articles is unclear. We provide novel evidence on this question by exploiting a natural experiment in which six high-impact, usually gated AERA journals became open access for a 2-month period in 2017. Using monthly download data and an always-open-access journal as a comparison group, we show that making journals open access likely increased article downloads in those journals by 55% to 95% per month. Given a per-article download price of $36, this suggests a relatively elastic response: The average price elasticity of demand for downloads is 1.2, with individual journal elasticities ranging from 0.6 to 2.";"[Gershenson, Seth; Wang, Rui] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Gershenson, Seth] Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Polikoff, Morgan S.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, 3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA";"Gershenson, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.; Gershenson, S (corresponding author), Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany.";"gershens@american.edu; polikoff@usc.edu; rw3515a@american.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;1;1;3;3;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

Concurrently, articles published in Educational Researcher examined new potential to increase the success of educational innovation through researcher-practitioner collaboration, focusing squarely on continuous improvement grounded in problems of practice. This essay examines how impact and improvement play out in the leadership of network-based improvement initiatives. Integrating critical scholarship with analysis of 20 i3-funded networks, the argument is that the practical challenges of network leaders vary inversely with system-level innovation infrastructure, which currently provides strong support for evaluating impact but weak support for continuous improvement. Thus, additional potential to increase the success of educational innovation is argued to lie in strengthening system-level innovation infrastructure to support the simultaneous pursuit of impact and improvement.";"[Peurach, Donald J.] Univ Michigan, Educ Policy Leadership & Innovat, Sch Educ, 610 E Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";"Peurach, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Educ Policy Leadership & Innovat, Sch Educ, 610 E Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.";"dpeurach@umich.edu";NA;NA;"William T.

This finding has been influential to the field; however, Coleman himself suggested that-had longitudinal data been available to him-decomposing the variance in students' growth rates rather than their levels of achievement would have provided a clearer insight into school effects. Inspired by an intriguing finding from an earlier study conducted in 1988 by Bryk and Raudenbush, we take up Coleman's suggestion using data provided by NWEA, which has administered over 200 million vertically scaled assessments across all 50 states since 2008. We replicated Bryk and Raudenbush's surprising finding that most of the variation in student learning rates lies between rather than within schools. For students moving from Grades 1 through 5, we found 75% (math) to 80% (English language arts) of the variance in achievement rates is at the school level. We find similar results in preliminary analyses of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class 1998-99 (ECLS-K:99). These results are intriguing because they call into question one of the dominant narratives about the extent to which schools shape students' achievement; however, more research is needed. Our goal is to invite other scholars to conduct similar analyses in other data contexts. We delineate four key dimensions along which results need to be further probed, first and foremost with an eye toward the role of test score scaling practices, which may be of central importance.";"[Atteberry, Allison C.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McEachin, Andrew J.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA";"Atteberry, AC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.";"allison.atteberry@colorado.edu; mceachin@rand.org";NA;"ATTEBERRY, ALLISON/0000-0002-9409-4372";NA;NA;NA;37;0;0;1;1;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

However, the extant literature in both K-12 and higher education contexts regarding class size is equivocal, with some citing evidence of an adverse effect on student achievement for larger class sizes and others suggesting minimal effect. This study aims to explore the relationship between class size and student achievement, as measured by course grades, in the core undergraduate program at Temple University, a large, state-related university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A cross-classified multilevel model was employed consisting of 14 variables-6 student level and 8 class-level-and drawing from a robust sample size of 172,516 grades awarded to 32,766 students in 8,049 classes offered across 14 terms. Results suggest that, after controlling for instructor experience, the effect of class size is not uniform and is, in fact, quite variable when accounting for student race, gender, and academic discipline within the same model. We discuss the possible reasons for these variable results with implications for program policy and classroom practice.

Since then, many in the education community have questioned whether differences in student test scores reflect actual discrepancies in the long-term well-being of individuals. In this review, we try to address this question in the light of the extant literature that examines the relationship between test scores and later life outcomes. We show that while there are certainly studies that contradict the causality of this relationship, there is also abundant evidence suggesting a causal link between test scores and later life outcomes. We conclude that any debate about the use of test scores in educational accountability (1) should be framed by use of all relevant empirical evidence, (2) should also consider the predictive validity of nontest measures of student success, and (3) should keep in mind that the predictive validity of test scores could be stronger in some contexts than others.";"[Goldhaber, Dan] Amer Inst Res, CALDER, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Ozek, Umut] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA";"Goldhaber, D (corresponding author), Amer Inst Res, CALDER, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.";"dgoldhaber@air.org; uozek@air.org";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;37;4;4;0;10;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

These designs can be implemented relatively inexpensively, often drawing on publicly available data on aggregate school performance. However, the validity of this approach hinges on a variety of assumptions and design decisions that are not clearly outlined in the literature. This article aims to serve as a practice guide for applied researchers when deciding how and whether to use this approach. We begin by providing an overview of the assumptions needed to estimate causal effects using school-level data, common threats to validity faced in practice and what effects can and cannot be estimated using school-level data. We then examine two analytic decisions researchers face in practice when implementing the design: correctly modeling the pretreatment functional form, which is modeling the preintervention trend, and selecting comparison cases. We then illustrate the use of this design in practice drawing on data from the implementation of the school improvement grant (SIG) program in Ohio.

Other challenges include communicating with non-English-speaking families to support learning. The author reviews research on the intersecting areas of rural education and EL education. The subfield of rural EL education has been underexamined across the research community, and nationally there is need to examine the backgrounds, languages, and learning needs of this group of students. The author highlights five pressing areas: knowledge of the characteristics and demographics of EL students and families across rural designations; language education approaches, models, and practices for EL students; hiring and retaining teachers of ELs in rural settings; and professional development for mainstream teachers and leaders of rural EL students.

Policy implications for educational interventions that seek to attract low-income students of color in urban areas and influence their trajectories at earlier stages of student development are discussed.";"[Shackelford, Daniel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Educ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA";"Shackelford, D (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Educ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.";"danielshackelford@jhu.edu";NA;NA;"Baltimore Education Research Consortium";"The author gratefully acknowledges the support from the Baltimore Education Research Consortium, without which this study would not have been possible.

We investigate the barriers to principals' use of teacher effectiveness measures in eight urban districts and charter management organizations that are investing in new systems for collecting such measures and making them available to school leaders and the supports central offices are building to help principals overcome those barriers. Interviews with more than 175 central and school leaders identify barriers in three main areas related to accessing measures, analyzing them, and taking action based on their analysis. Supports fall into four categories: professional development, connecting principals to sources of expertise, creating new structures or tools, and building a data use culture.

David Krathwohl (1969) called for a coherent community encompassing practitioners, policymakers, and researchers. Philip Jackson (1990) urged that local research knowledge, rather than research-based dictates, be communicated. Alan Schoenfeld (1999) challenged education researchers simultaneously to build knowledge and offer solutions to practical problems.

Using a district-level panel data set from 1998 to 2015, we describe and model changes in within-district segregation of low-income students, proxied by free-lunch eligibility (FLE). We show that the segregation of FLE students from non-FLE students increased by about 15% in large school districts and find that charter school penetration and growth played a role in increasing socioeconomic segregation within districts. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in charter enrollment rates increases the dissimilarity index in a district by 6% of a standard deviation. Although this impact is modest, we do find that segregation is more pervasive in the charter sector. So, continued growth of charter schools could exacerbate socioeconomic segregation.";"[Marcotte, Dave E.] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Marcotte, Dave E.] IZA, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Dalane, Kari] Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA";"Marcotte, DE (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.; Marcotte, DE (corresponding author), IZA, Washington, DC 20037 USA.";"marcotte@american.edu; kd5010a@student.american.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;48;1;1;1;7;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

Even as post-Brown desegregation went into effect, thousands of Native American children continued to attend segregated, English-only federal boarding schools. This lecture considers the Brown legacy and broader issues of education equality in the context of research, policy, and practice in Indigenous education. Focusing on a core argument in Brownthat equality of opportunity is a prerequisite so that any child may succeedI examine hard-fought pathways toward education justice forged by Indigenous educators, parents, leaders, and allies; the larger settler colonial project in which those efforts are embedded; and the ways in which Indigenous initiatives are braided with those of other racialized groups. Key to this analysis is recognition that equal access and uniformity of education approach are not synchronous with equity.

To address this problem, Ghana has implemented a teacher education reform since 2004 to incorporate practicum. However, the critical role of teacher educators has been overlooked by policymakers, and few studies have qualitatively investigated their practice and vision. The study draws on qualitative data from the Ghana component of the Teacher Preparation in Africa (TPA) research project to explore eight teacher educators' practice and vision of good teaching of primary mathematics. The study found that teacher educators' practice and vision of good teaching consist of the use of teaching and learning materials (TLMs) and small group activities following specific steps without understanding the principles of learner-centered pedagogy that could be applied in a variety of classroom contexts and mathematics topics. The study also identified the hierarchical relationship between teacher educators and school teachers as a major challenge for effective practicum, limiting the opportunity to transform teacher educators' vision and practice of primary mathematics teaching.

This revenue stream is often ignored in analyses of state aid for K-12 and its distribution across districts. Until recently, accounting standards did not require pension plans to report these implicit subsidies to the school districts, so they did not typically know the size of their subsidy. In some important cases, it was missing from state totals for education aid. In the first comprehensive tabulation of these data, we show that this subsidy can be as much as $2,400 per pupil, as it is in Connecticut.

Beginning with the first president of AERA, a number of presidents through the late 1940s are highlighted, as well as how their work spoke to the times they lived in and how its impact continues through this centennial year. The history stops with the 1950s, which ushered in a new era of significant innovations in research methodology and statistical techniques, strong criticisms of the quality of education research, and a growing recognition of the importance of education in promoting U.S. economic development and social reform. The intent of this essay is to discuss how the legacy of education research, unfamiliar to many of us, shaped how we approach issues of testing, measurement, and student abilitysome for the best, others fueling debates and inertia for sustainable reform.";"[Schneider, Barbara] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, 516 Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schneider, Barbara] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, 516 Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";"Schneider, B (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, 516 Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Schneider, B (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, 516 Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.";"bschneid@msu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;34;0;0;0;0;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

In part because it often relies on self-reported data from population-based self-administered questionnaires, this research is susceptible to misclassification bias whereby youths who are not SMYs are classified as such and vice versa. I introduce a taxonomy of classification errors, including seven unique sources, and discuss the potential effects of each error on estimates of youth outcomes. Through examples, I illustrate how researchers can detect and correct such errors and discuss how piecewise attempts to address bias can sometimes unintentionally exacerbate other forms of bias. Finally, I propose a unified conceptual model for addressing the various error sources, urging researchers to take a proactive and integrative approach to data validity by attending to errors at each step in the research process, from questionnaire development to data analysis. Although I focus on errors specific to the topic of sexuality research on youths, this argument can serve as a broader template for the development of taxonomies of error along other dimensions considered in educational research, such as race and disability status.";"[Cimpian, Joseph R.] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Econ & Educ Policy, Kimball Hall,246 Greene St,Room 203W, New York, NY 10003 USA";"Cimpian, JR (corresponding author), NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Econ & Educ Policy, Kimball Hall,246 Greene St,Room 203W, New York, NY 10003 USA.";"joseph.cimpian@nyu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;51;9;9;0;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0013-189X";"1935-102X";NA;"EDUC RESEARCHER";"Educ.

However, when these spaces receive attention, their social and political complexity is often overlooked. Studying the complexity of community-based youth work in education requires interrogating the multiple systems of oppression that impact young people's lives. It also demands examination of the sociopolitical context of youth work, including how race logics and economic pressures inform the construction of CBES and how these forces surface and intersect with market logics and educational policy reform. Building on existing scholarship on community-based youth work and my current research, I present the youthwork paradox, a framework that captures the complexity of the field and its relationship to structural forces and larger systems of oppression. I detail how this paradox does not always lead to dichotomous discourses; rather, CBES can encompass many logics at once.

Because under-represented minorities are over-represented in these courses, remedial courses obstruct equitable access and success. Schools are increasingly turning instead to supplemental instruction and Internet-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). But these alternatives don't generate tuition, are difficult to evaluate, and can require substantial infrastructure.

Propensity-score techniques were used to control for biased selection and assignment. We found that spending approximately 30 h on a $30 ITS was equally as effective as spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of tuition on a three or five credit remedial course in terms of final grades in Principles for the entire population as well as for under-represented minorities.

Latent Class Analysis method as a clustering approach of educational data mining was employed to extract common activity features of 612 courses in a large private university located in South Korea by using online behavior data tracked from Learning Management System and institution's course database. Four unique subtypes were identified. Approximately 50% of the courses manifested inactive utilization of LMS or immature stage of blended learning implementation, which is labeled as Type I.

In this paper we depart from familiar approaches and evaluate one such example of a tool's development (SRES - Student Relationship Engagement System). SRES' adoption and scaling across two institutions are evaluated using an auto-ethnographic approach scaffolded through the dimensions of the SHEILA framework, focusing on the individual perspectives of the institutional champions who have been central to this journey. This practical approach and the emerging insights may enable other institutions to identify areas of potential improvement and inform senior academic managers about the strategic requirements to scale the approach, accounting for aspects not considered in the initial 'organic growth' of the implementation.";"[Vigentini, Lorenzo] UNSW Sydney, PVC Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Liu, Danny Y.

This study examined how various factors associated with the online learning experience - students' demographics, prior online learning experience, satisfaction, and sense of preparedness for the course after completing an online learning orientation - influence online students' feelings of anxiety. Using a binary logistic regression, our findings confirmed that demographics (i.e., female, full-time, first year online student), prior online learning experience, and sense of preparedness predicted online students' feelings of anxiety.

Minimal differences were found in the frequency of social presence indicators between text and video feedback. However, we warn against interpreting this finding too simplistically.

The findings indicated that pinners' collection on the Pinterest board celebrated various uses of language and multimodal signifiers as different examples of language use. Thus, pins revealed pinners' interpretation of what made particular instances of language use psycholinguistic examples. The affordances of the Pinterest board as a public site allowed pinners to engage in on-going communication with their fellow pinners and the greater Internet public. Both images and accompanying messages revealed pinners' intentions to express their thoughts about noteworthy language use and to invite their audience to pay attention to what they had shared. The Pinterest activity as digital curation created a participatory culture that encouraged students' collaboration and informal learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Diverse states of discourse during CSCiL occur in sequences, but we do not yet fully understand which patterns are beneficial to learning and when exactly to foster them. This study used transition-rate analysis, entropy-analysis, and sequential pattern mining to analyze the chat message of 144 students of two-year colleges. The participants worked on tasks related to Ohm's Law in a simulation-based collaborative-inquiry-learning environment. The results revealed that students in groups who completed tasks successfully tended to ensure that everyone in their group had a shared understanding of the relationship between the variables before they moved on to the next step. In contrast, students in groups who did not complete tasks successfully were more likely to regulate the process without reaching a shared understanding.

In this paper, the authors applied that framework as well as Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory to determine the degree to which institutional strategy, structure, and support measures facilitate or impede BL adoption among higher education faculty. In addition, the authors explored whether higher education faculty's innovation adoption category affects which measures facilitate or impede BL adoption. To achieve these objectives, the authors surveyed 214 faculty and interviewed 39 faculty at a school in the adoption/early implementation stage of BL adoption.

Because self-regulated learning is critical to success in online learning, measures reflecting self-regulated learning were included to examine the relationship between LMS data measures and course achievement. Data were collected from 530 college students who took an online course. The results demonstrated that students' regular study, late submissions of assignments, number of sessions (the frequency of course logins), and proof of reading the course information packets significantly predicted their course achievement. These findings verify the importance of self-regulated learning and reveal the advantages of using measures related to meaningful learning behaviors rather than simple frequency measures. Furthermore, the measures collected in the middle of the course significantly predicted course achievement, and the findings support the potential for early prediction using learning performance data. Several implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, less than 5% of the scholarship on blending in higher education explores academic practice (e.g. teaching, curriculum design, professional development and training for instruction; Torrisi-Steele & Drew, 2013). This discussion reports the results of a systematic review of the literature on faculty member's adoption and use of online tools for face-to-face instruction. Six influences that cut across the literature are identified: faculty member's interactions with technology, academic workload, institutional environment, interactions with students, the instructor's attitudes and beliefs about teaching, and opportunities for professional development. Strengths and limitations of the literature and future directions for research on socio-technical systems of instruction are identified.

Whereas highly popular social services like Facebook and Twitter have been thoroughly investigated for their benefits for teaching and learning in higher education, other social media platforms which have been gaining considerable attention among youth have been largely overlooked in scholarly literature. The purpose of this study is to fill that vacuum by analyzing whether and how social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp have become an integral component of teaching and learning in higher education. A total of 46 studies are analyzed in terms of what pedagogical affordances of these four platforms they identify (e.g., mixing information and learning resources, hybridization of expertise, widening of the context of learning) and the benefits for learning that the authors go on to investigate. Results show that although the use of WhatsApp is well documented in a plethora of studies, there is a dearth of research about Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat. While more than half of the studies are carried out in the Middle East and Asian areas and investigate mostly benefits for second and foreign language learning, the overall geographical distribution of studies examining learning via social media reflects the preferences expressed for these services on the part of the general population. Moreover, it is found that the pedagogical affordances of social media are still only being partially implemented and that diverse social media exploit affordances to different degrees.";"[Manca, Stefania] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Educ Technol, Via De Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy";"Manca, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Educ Technol, Via De Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy.";"stefania.manca@itd.cnr.it";"Manca, Stefania/E-5575-2014";"Manca, Stefania/0000-0002-0348-7139";NA;NA;NA;137;1;1;5;12;"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC";"NEW YORK";"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA";"1096-7516";"1873-5525";NA;"INTERNET HIGH EDUC";"Internet High.

Students appointed with leadership roles are able to positively affect the dynamics in their groups by engaging with participants, raising questions, and advancing problem solving. To help monitoring and controlling the latent social dynamics associated with leadership behavior, we propose a methodological approach that makes use of computational techniques to mine the content of online communications and analyze group structure to identify students who behave as leaders. Through text mining and social network analysis, we systematically process the discussion posts made by students from four sections of an online course in an American university. The results allow us to quantify each individual's contribution and summarize their engagement in the form of a leadership index. The proposed methodology, when compared to judgements made by experts who manually coded samples of the data, is shown to have comparable performances, but, being fully automated, has the potential to be easily replicable.

Twenty-seven participants from a university in Cyprus reciprocally assessed the digital learning products they prepared as they engaged in a web-based study unit on marine ecosystems and in particular prey-predator relationships. Data were collected through screen-video capture, peer feedback protocols, pre and post-instructional tests and interviews, as well as the students' learning products. Data were exposed to qualitative analysis and then also treated quantitatively through the use of non-parametric tests. Our analysis led to the identification of a range of student profiles characterizing different peer-assessment patterns. In the peer-assessor role, students were distinguished into autonomous and informed assessors; whereas in the case of the assessee role they were discriminated into engaged but unlucky, disinterested and engaged assessees. Students' learning gains were associated with their actions as peer-assessees and their attitudes towards peer feedback. The findings have implications for teaching practice as well as policy for teaching and learning in web-based learning environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Besides the traditional classroom learning for both groups, the experimental group was also supported with bite-sized multimedia materials and teacher-student interaction via WhatsApp outside school hours. The participants of the control group used WhatsApp only for academic communication. Pre-test scores were used as the covariate. The marginal means on the post-test scores showed that the participants in the experimental group performed better than those in the control group. The intervention of WhatsApp improved the learning achievement of the participants. The strength of the intervention between the two groups was medium to large. A questionnaire designed by the author was administered at the end of the study. The participants showed positive perception and acceptance of the use of WhatsApp for teaching and learning. The participants slightly rejected the view that receiving instructional materials and questions outside school hours could interfere with their private lives.

Individually, cognitive presence turned out to be the best predictor of intrinsic load while teaching presence was the best predictor of extraneous and total loads. Even though social presence was not a best predictor on its own, it contributed to the presences prediction of cognitive load as a group. As a result, all these findings pointed to a small-size predictive power of the presences on cognitive load thereby providing evidence for their incremental predictive validity and the importance of perceived learning satisfaction.

When student participation is stimulated by grading formative tests that are held in an unproctored online environment, this raises the issue of academic dishonesty. In the literature, a debate is waged on the prevalence of cheating in unproctored online environments. The issue is whether online exams are invitations to cheat. We add to this literature by using the Harmon & Lambrinos (2008) and Jacob & Levitt (2003) approaches to detect cheating. Next, we go one step further by exploring whether cheating in online formative tests will do the suspected perpetrators any good. This is a non-trivial question, as students that cheat at formative tests forsake the opportunity to enhance their learning and may suffer the consequences in subsequent proctored summative tests. We investigate this using data from a large School of Economics in the Netherlands. We calculate a score that indicates the likelihood of cheating, based on unexpected grade patterns, and find that this score is negatively related to academic progress. Our evidence thus suggests that while cheating in online formative tests may happen, it does not seem to pay off. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";"[Arnold, Ivo J.

In this context, as course participants increasingly establish interpersonal relationships among peers they have greater opportunity to draw on and leverage the latent social capital that resides in such a distributed learning environment. However, to date there have been a limited number of studies exploring how learners build their social capital in open large-scale courses. To inform the facilitation of learner networks in open online settings and beyond, this study analyzed factors associated with how learners accumulate social capital in the form of learner connections over time. The study was conducted in two massive open online course offerings (Connectivism and Connective Knowledge) that were designed on the principles of connectivist pedagogy and that made use of data about social interaction from Twitter, blogs, and Facebook. For this purpose, linear mixed modeling was used to understand the associations between learner social capital, linguistic and discourse patterns, media used for interaction, as well as the time in the course when interaction took place. The results highlight the association between the language used by the learners and the creation of ties between them.

The Community of Inquiry survey instrument, administered as the part of the post-course survey, was used to measure student perceived levels of the three presences. Cluster analysis revealed three different groups of students with unique study strategies: limited users, selective users, and broad users. The strategies adopted significantly differed in student use of available tools and resources, final course grade, as well as the perceived levels of cognitive presence. The results also indicate there were significant differences regarding student commitment to learning, motivations and goals for enrolling in a MOOC, as well as goal orientation, approaches to learning, and the use of different study strategies.

An innovative synchronous videoconferencing technology was used to examine the assumptions of the Medium Naturalness Theory (Kock, 2005), which compares the characteristics of different media to face-to-face communication, having the highest degree of naturalness. The data was collected in two settings: (1) a controlled lab experiment (76 participants), in which teaching-learning interactions were compared across three communication channels (face-to-face, one-way and two-way synchronous lessons) and (2) synchronous lessons in real-life academic courses (87 participants). Four factors that play a major role in participation in online discussions were examined: medium naturalness, teaching-learning style, personality traits (extroversion-introversion and emotional stability-neuroticism), and the growing acquaintance between participants as the course progresses. The findings of Study 1 revealed passive learning behavior among the majority of participants, who tended not to interrupt the instructor's lecture, spontaneously ask questions, or initiate interactions. However, participation was much higher and more frequent when the instructor explicitly encouraged the students to participate, comment, and ask questions. As for the effect of personality traits, extroverts spoke more in almost all types of teaching-learning interactions; however, no effect was found for emotional stability-neuroticism. Consistent with the findings of the first study, the findings of Study 2 indicated that transferring the responsibility for learning from the instructor to the students, by allowing them to lead the lesson, promoted their participation and initiation of interactions.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the prerequisite course learning environment on student performance in post-requisite coursework. This study focused on undergraduate accounting, and employed a mixed methods approach to answer two main research questions. First, does student performance in post-requisite undergraduate accounting education vary based on the learning environment of the prerequisite course? Second, how do the learning environments of prerequisite and post-requisite courses influence student perceptions of the undergraduate accounting course sequence? The results of this study indicate that student academic performance in the post-requisite course does not vary based on the learning environment of the prerequisite course. Additionally, while all students report encountering challenges, face-to-face students rely on self-study, collaboration with peers, and tutoring to overcome these challenges. Conversely, online students rely primarily on self-study to resolve similar challenges. The findings of this study suggest administrators should consider offering online prerequisite courses before, or in conjunction with their associated post-requisites, and provide similar access to external resources to assist with student learning challenges irrespective of learning environment.

We identify weeks 5-6 (half way through the semester) as an optimal time to implement an early warning system, as it allows time for the students to make changes to their study patterns while retaining reasonable prediction accuracy. Using detailed variables, clustering and our final prediction method of BART (Bayesian Additive Regressive Trees) we can predict students' final mark by week 6 based on mean absolute error to 6.5 percentage points.

Firstly, three motivational profiles were distinguished. Furthermore, the students value the flexibility and the face-to-face moments in OBL. However, based upon students' current experiences, costs - seen as negative aspects of OBL - seem to emerge. While students mainly mention costs regarding education in general (e.g. a high workload), they also indicate specific costs concerning OBL (e.g. harder to organise group work).

Content analysis of post content linked tool usage with students' increased attempts to solicit peer responses to their posts and increased reflection on individual participation. However, the tool was not found useful or easy to use by some students, and it did not show benefits in other aspects of online discussion, such as crafting stronger argumentation or reflecting on group processes.

Substantial differences were detected between the self-described learning behaviours of these two groups in five of the sub-processes examined.

It investigated associations amongst conceptions of learning through discussions, approaches to face-to-face and online discussions, and academic achievement amongst two cohorts of postgraduates (N = 387 and N = 184) in the same business course over two consecutive years in an Australian university. Inclusion of two studies allowed an examination of the extent to which the relationships amongst variables were consistent and stable. The two studies showed logical and stable relationship amongst key variables: cohesive conceptions of learning through discussions were positively linked with deep approaches that students adopted towards discussions in class and online, which also related positively to better academic achievement.

While educational research provides article-related suggestions for learner's support, research has rarely analyzed the potentials of supporting learning-related processes at the talk page level. With the presented experiment, we address this issue by investigating effects of visual controversy awareness information on content-related discussion threads. Such information can induce socio-cognitive conflicts which research assumes to be beneficial for learning, particularly when contradictory evidence leads Wiki discussions. We investigated how controversy awareness highlighting as implicit guidance directs students' (N = 81) navigation and learning processes as wells as their internalized knowledge representations. Results indicate that the implementation of controversy awareness representations helped students to focus on selecting meaningful discussion threads. Our findings suggest that Wiki talk page users can benefit from additional structuring aids and increase their learning outcome when being aware of occurring controversies.

A survey tool was addressed to the entire Italian academic staff, with a response rate of 10.5% corresponding to 6139 responses. The study takes into account a number of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, numbers of years of teaching, academic title, and academic discipline. It also explores the relationship between the different kinds of use, the, relationship between frequency of use of Social Media and online and/or blended teaching, as well as the use of institutional e-learning systems. The results show that Social Media use is still rather limited and restricted and that the variable most associated with frequency of use is scientific discipline. In addition, age and seniority seem to influence the adoption of Social Media. The results also revealed that frequency of personal use is mostly associated with the frequency of professional use more than with the frequency of teaching use. They also show that prior experience with e learning or blended learning is greatly associated with Social Media use. Overall, the study emphasises a generally more favourable attitude towards personal sharing and connecting with peers in professional networks rather than integrating these devices into their teaching practices.

In this regard, the present study aims to determine the effects of gamification-based teaching practices on student achievement and their attitudes toward lesson. Investigating the effects of gamification on instructional processes and educational outcomes is expected to contribute to the relevant literature as it is a relatively new mechanism. The study is designed with quantitative research methodology and a true experimental design using pretest-posttest experimental and control groups. The study's participants included 97 sophomores from the Department of Elementary Mathematics Education of a state university in southern Turkey in 2014-2015. The experimental group comprised 49 students compared to 48 students in the control group.

With the rapid growth of a number of online course offerings, there are an increasing number of adult learners entering or returning to universities. Despite the growing number of non-traditional adult students in online higher education, little is known about the dynamic processes of adult distance learning, through which adult students struggle to develop their learning ability, to balance their life and study, and to become self regulated learners - ultimately competent selves and lifelong learners. Therefore, this article describes ten adult students' learning experiences from their enrolment in a distance programme to their completion of the programme many years later and deconstructs common assumptions of adult distance learners: namely, that they are a homogenous group with intrinsic and static characteristics that spring from their adultness or matureness.";"[Lee, Kyungmee] Univ Lancaster, Dept Educ Res, Lancaster LA1 4YD, Lancs, England; [Choi, Hyoseon] Chosun Univ, Dept Med Educ, Coll Med, Gwangju, South Korea; [Cho, Young Hoan] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Educ, Seoul, South Korea";"Lee, K (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Educ Res, Lancaster LA1 4YD, Lancs, England.";"k.lee23@lancaster.ac.uk; goodluck@chosun.ac.kr; yhcho95@snu.ac.kr";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;43;1;1;3;14;"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC";"NEW YORK";"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA";"1096-7516";"1873-5525";NA;"INTERNET HIGH EDUC";"Internet High.

Based on a series of interviews with university educators and emergency management practitioners this paper investigates how the CoI framework can support the effective use of WBS to deliver disaster studies curricula in the higher education context.

However, due to challenges unique to each group, the variety of SRL strategies that are implicated, and their effect size for predicting performance may differ across contexts. One hundred and forty online students and 466 blended learning students completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. The results show that online students utilised SRL strategies more often than blended learning students, with the exception of peer learning and help seeking. Despite some differences in individual predictive value across enrolment status, the key SRL predictors of academic performance were largely equivalent between online and blended learning students. Findings highlight the relative importance of using time management and elaboration strategies, while avoiding rehearsal strategies, in relation to academic subject grade for both study modes.

These methods explored: 1) the frequency of student self initiated use of social media, focusing on Twitter, 2) students' perceptions of Twitter, and 3) factors that would discourage or facilitate students' use of Twitter for learning. Results suggest students perceive Twitter as a platform where student knowledge and power is subordinated to leading Twitter users from relevant disciplines or professions, but also as a platform for enhancing career/business.

The study examined the 'Fundamentals of Clinical Trials' MOOC offered by edX, and presents narrative descriptions of learning drawn from interviews with 35 course participants. The descriptions provide an insight into the goal-setting, self-efficacy, learning and task strategies, and help-seeking of professionals choosing to study this MOOC. Gaining an insight into how these self-regulatory processes are or are not enacted highlights potential opportunities for pedagogic and technical design of MOOCs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Forty-five pre-service teachers in two sections of an undergraduate course participated in two online discussion activities. A crossover study was conducted to examine student participation and interaction, and students' perceived learning experience in the two environments. In the first activity, students in Section A used Diigo for the online discussion while students in Section B used a threaded discussion forum. In the second activity, the two sections switched their online discussion environments. A participatory survey was administered at the end of the study. Postings in the two activities were analyzed and compared in terms of participation, focus, and interaction types. The results indicated that the different design of the two activities and the different functions of two environments impacted student participation, knowledge construction processes, and the foci of discussions. Social annotation tools could be used as an alternative environment to encourage certain types of interaction during online discussions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, low course completion rates by on-campus students in online courses have become an area of concern. This study seeks to identify factors associated with unsuccessful online course completion and withdrawal by investigating course completion rates in an online physics lecture course. The authors use eight years of data (N = 3032) to establish lecture course completion patterns then compare these patterns with three semesters (N = 940) of a hybrid course combining online lecture with face-to-face laboratories. Deviations from established patterns are identified and student characteristics which are uniquely associated with unsuccessful course completion and withdrawal in online sections are isoloated. Differences in rates of students repeating the class, lower rates of repeating student completion in online sections, and early disengagement by repeating students are found to be important. Results imply the need for early course interventions and/or potential policies regarding repeating students.

Factor analyses revealed five factors (management of time and effort; complex cognitive strategy use; simple cognitive strategy use; contacts with others; academic thinking), including fewer items, which resulted in a shorter list than the original learning strategies part of the MSLQ. Cognitive strategies and management of time and effort were used most by adult DE students, contacts with others were used least. Compared to traditional college students, the findings in adult DE may be explained by a differential interpretation of items based on differences between educational systems, living and study circumstances, and age and experiences. The newly developed subscales may be considered for future research on learning strategies of students within adult DE in which the students can determine their own time, place, and pace of study.";"[Meijs, Celeste; Neroni, Joyce; Gijselaers, Hieronymus J.

Although online education continues to become an increasingly mainstream mode of instruction, certain student groups may engage disproportionately with computer-mediated instruction. Weighted descriptive statistics revealed that the proportion of postsecondary students who enrolled in online courses increased from 5.9% in 2000 to 32.1% in 2012, with 23.6% of students enrolled in some online courses and 8.5% of students enrolled in fully online programs. Empirical evidence suggested that student characteristics associated with the highest opportunity costs of engaging with residential education such as being a full-time employee, parent, or married were more likely to enroll in some online courses and online-only programs. In addition, economically and socially disadvantaged students were typically less likely to engage with online education. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Students' prior experience with computers and smartphones, as well as the teacher support they receive during in-class instruction (in blended learning scenarios), are essential components of the e-learning experience that must be accounted for when seeking to explain students' motivation and learning outcomes in these contexts. This study therefore aimed to test the longitudinal effects of teacher support, prior subject competence, and prior experience with computers and smartphones, on student motivation for e-learning and finally e-learning completion. Employing five data points collected over one academic year, first-year Japanese university students (n = 975) studying English as a foreign language completed surveys at three time points. Cross-lagged panel structural equation modelling was undertaken with the finalized latent variables, prior subject competency (standardized test), and year-end e-learning completion rates. Perceived teacher support was found to have a broad range of direct and mediated effects on students' motivations for e learning. Effort beliefs were consistent predictors of task value and ability beliefs after accounting for auto lagged effects. E-learning completion was chiefly predicted by ability beliefs. The practical and theoretical implications for e-learning are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores the relations between scripted online peer feedback processes and quality of written argumentative essay as they occur in an authentic learning situation with direct practical relevance. Furthermore, the effects of the online argumentative peer feedback script on students' written argumentative essay are studied. A pre-test, post-test design was used with 189 undergraduate students who were assigned to groups of three. They were asked to explore various perspectives, and the 'pros and cons' on the topic of 'Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)' in order to write an argumentative essay in the field of biotechnology. The findings reveal that successful students and groups differ in terms of their feedback quality than less-successful students and groups. This implies that when students engage in high-quality, elaborated and justified peer feedback processes, they write high-quality argumentative essays. Furthermore, the results show that the online argumentative peer feedback script enhances the quality of students' written argumentative essay.

Web-based collaborative concept mapping was used to mediate small group learning among college students in an online environment. The findings revealed that there were differences in the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group interaction between the two task situations; collaborative concept mapping functioned more effectively in facilitating group interaction in the concept oriented task situation than in the design-oriented task situation in several ways.";"[Wang, Minhong; Cheng, Bo; Chen, Juanjuan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, KM & EL Lab, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mercer, Neil] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England; [Kirschner, Paul A.] Open Univ Netherlands, Welten Inst, Heerlen, Netherlands";"Wang, MH (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.";"magwang@hku.hk; bob88708@hku.hk; jjchen12@hku.hk; nnun31@cam.ac.uk; Paul.Kirschner@ou.nl";"CHEN, Juanjuan/N-2586-2019";"CHEN, Juanjuan/0000-0002-1273-9465; Wang, Minhong/0000-0002-1084-6814; Kirschner, Paul A./0000-0002-8743-0462";NA;NA;NA;69;27;27;7;51;"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC";"NEW YORK";"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA";"1096-7516";"1873-5525";NA;"INTERNET HIGH EDUC";"Internet High.

Additionally, existing studies confirm the vital role of adult education in the inclusion process of citizens in our contemporary society. However, questions remain unanswered as to what specific factors of the learning environment contribute to these social outcomes, except in educational programmes explicitly directed at social inclusion. Responding to this literature gap, the present study (1) investigated the effect of CSE and online interaction quality on adults' learning performance and (2) scrutinized how online interaction quality and learning performance affect their bonding and bridging social capital. Participants (N = 140) were learners from a blended learning programme in centres for adult education in Belgium. Path analyses showed that only CSE significantly predicted adults' learning performance. Online interaction quality was found to have a significant effect on learners' bonding and bridging social capital, but not learning performance. To this end, the findings highlight the importance of dispositional factors regarding adults' achievement in a blended learning environment and the potential of such programmes to enhance their social outcomes in addition to cognitive gains.";"[Diep, Nguyet A.; Cocquyt, Celine; Zhu, Chang; Vanwing, Tom; de Greef, Maurice] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Educ Sci, Brussels, Belgium";"Diep, NA (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Educ Sci, Brussels, Belgium.";"diep.anh.nguyet@vub.ac.be";"Zhu, Chang/AAH-3840-2020; Zhu, Chang/F-8201-2012";"Zhu, Chang/0000-0002-0057-275X; Zhu, Chang/0000-0002-0057-275X; Diep, Anh Nguyet/0000-0001-5134-3220; Vanwing, Tom/0000-0001-8572-8217";"Vrije Universiteit Brussel within Strategic Research Program (SRP) [SRP28]";"This research is funded by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (SRP28) within the Strategic Research Program (SRP) framework.";NA;92;4;4;5;24;"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC";"NEW YORK";"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA";"1096-7516";"1873-5525";NA;"INTERNET HIGH EDUC";"Internet High.

This article presents a prediction model based on low-cost variables and a sophisticated algorithm, to predict early which students attending large classes (with more than 50 enrollments) who are at risk of failing a course. Therefore, it will enable instructors and educational managers to carry out early interventions to prevent course failure. The results overperform other approaches in terms of accuracy, cost, and generalization.

This paper proposes a novel OCW tool called Cooperpad, with a group awareness functionality, which continuously gathers group members' writing behavior, analyzes and visualize their engagement intensity for group members to compare their participation with that of others. Using direct observations, a post-test-only design with an experimental group (N = 72) and a control group (N = 48), we have examined whether access to Cooperpad's group awareness function showed more engagement in a group-writing task than students without access to the tool. Results of direct observation indicate that Cooperpad with the group awareness support increases students' behavioral engagement, compared with a common synchronous OCW tool (without visualization support). In addition, the results show that the quality of writing in the experiment group is significantly greater than that of the control group when performing difficult tasks.";"[Liu, Ming] Southwest Univ, Fac Educ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Educ Res Inst, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Leping] Univ Nevada, Coll Educ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Liu, Li] Chongqing Univ, Sch Software Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China";"Liu, M (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Fac Educ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Educ Res Inst, Chongqing, Peoples R China.";"mingliu@swu.edu.cn; liu@unr.edu; dcsliuli@cqu.edu.cn";NA;"Liu, Li/0000-0002-4776-5292";"Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund Program [201485123]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU114005, CQU903005203326]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61502397]; Research Program Funds of Faculty of Education [2016YBJC01]; Research Project on Education and Teaching Reform at Southwest University [2017JY096]";"This work is supported by Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund Program under grant No. 201485123, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under grant No. SWU114005, CQU903005203326, and National Natural Science Foundation of China (61502397), and the Research Program Funds of Faculty of Education (2016YBJC01), and Research Project on Education and Teaching Reform at Southwest University (2017JY096).";NA;41;8;8;13;45;"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC";"NEW YORK";"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA";"1096-7516";"1873-5525";NA;"INTERNET HIGH EDUC";"Internet High.

The results from Survey 1 indicated that online students reported significantly lower levels of relatedness than their on-campus counterparts. Follow-up interviews were conducted with purposefully chosen students and faculty members. The findings suggested that four themes impact synchronous hybrid learning: peer relatedness, technology influence, instructor impact, and program structure. In vivo quotations were used to develop a scale to assess participants' self-efficacy of relatedness development. Survey 2 data indicated that the new scale had good psychometric quality and that students reported significantly greater levels of self-efficacy for relatedness development with classmates in their same attendance mode than with peers in the opposite format.

University students (N = 140) reported their attitudes towards assignment marking and feedback both online and offline, perceptions of social presence in each modality, and attitudes towards computers. The students also ranked their preferences for receiving feedback in terms of three binary characteristics: modality (online or offline), valence (positive or negative), and scope of feedback (general or specific). Although attitudes towards online and offline marking did not significantly differ, positive attitudes towards one modality were strongly correlated with negative attitudes towards the other modality. Greater perceptions of social presence within a modality were associated with more positive attitudes towards that modality. Binary characteristics were roughly equally weighted. Findings suggest that the online feedback modality will most effectively maximise student engagement if online assignment marking and feedback tools facilitate perceptions of social presence.

The participants, 82 undergraduate students, worked in small teams on a research method task over one semester. The instruments used for this study included a five-factor social ability scale and a one-dimensional perceived collaborative learning scale. The results showed moderate significant relationships between students' perceived team learning scores and students' peer social presence scores as well as weaker relationships between team learning and two social ability sub scales, written communication skills and instructor social presence. There appears to be an important effect of peer social presence that is linked to learning and performance. Using a blended learning model may have an important impact on increasing social interaction and learning with a team learning approach thereby helping students undertake comprehensive tasks and increase student learning.

A total of 53 respondents participated in this study and Baidu Post Bar was used as a tool to facilitate group interactions. A total of 604 dialogues comprising 5090 posts were analyzed to identify the differences in group characteristics and interactions. A strong group-controlling pattern was found in the online learning component, whereas an individual-controlling pattern was found in the face-to-face mode. The depth of the interactions among students increased from the beginning to the middle of the class and reached a relatively stable state from the middle to the end of the class. The interaction in the classroom was more in-depth than that in the online learning mode.

With a funding policy, the Dutch Government aims to stimulate OOE in HEIs. The goal is to create more expedient, accessible and personalized learning experiences, that contribute to an improvement of quality of education and study success. However, many projects are failing to embed OOE within the institution. In this study, we elicited the challenges and opportunities of OOE projects within an organizational context of Dutch HEIs by using group concept mapping. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering resulted in a cluster map and a pattern match graph for interpreting the experts' ideas and opinions, clarifying and structuring the collective understanding. Core themes that represent the challenges and opportunities with regard to OOE identified in this study were: 1. Online teaching, 2. Supporting mechanisms, 3. Assessment, 4.

Drawing on a model of online learning conceived as a nexus of cognitive, social and teaching presence, we focus principally on the interaction between cognitive and social presence, and the ways in which written language mediates social presence in fostering a critical disposition to professional learning. A key concept for analysing this is politeness, predicated on Goffman's construct of 'face', i.e. the work individuals do in presenting themselves to others. We conclude that the 'collective face wants' of the online community led to the creation of an online space in which participants were supported by their peers to do 'being critical'. The purpose of the analysis presented here is to contribute to theory around 'social presence' in order to further the understanding of collaborative learning in online spaces and hence to support the development of pedagogical practices aimed at facilitating this.

The capacity to determine future course load and student interests provides for increased accuracy in the allocation of resources including curriculum and learning support and career counselling services. Prior research in data mining has identified several models that can be applied to predict course selection based on the data residing in institutional information systems. However, these models only aim to predict the total number of students that may potentially enrol in a course. This prior work has not examined the prediction of the course enrolments with respect to the specific academic term and year in which the students will take those courses in the future. Moreover, these prior models operate under the assumption that all data stored within institutional information systems can be directly associated with an individual student's identity. This association with student identity is not always feasible due to government regulations (e.g., student evaluations of teaching and courses). In this paper, we propose an approach for extracting student preferences from sources available in institutional student information systems. The extracted preferences are analysed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to predict student course selection. The AHP-based approach was validated on a dataset collected in an undergraduate degree program at a Canadian research-intensive university (N = 1061). The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the student course predictions was high and equivalent to that of previous data mining approaches using fully identifiable data. The findings suggest that a students' grade point average relative to the grades of the courses they are considering for enrolment was the most important factor in determining future course selections. This finding is consistent with theories of modern counseling psychology that acknowledges self-efficacy as a critical factor in career planning.

The current study explored whether and how the pedagogical design of an academic course, which developed a variety of digital literacy competencies, supported students in regulating collaborative technology-enhanced learning and helped them cope with the sense of psychological ownership over collaborative learning outcomes. In addition, we examined how these issues were expressed in cognitive, emotional and social aspects of students' perceived learning (Caspi & Blau, 2011). During four semesters, we conducted a qualitative analysis on reflective learning diaries, written by 78 graduate students studying education (N = 1870 codes). The bottom-up analysis focused on learning processes that enabled the development of various digital literacies conceptualized by the Digital Literacy Framework (DLF; Eshet-Alkalai, 2012): photo-visual, information, reproduction, branching, social-emotional, and real-time thinking skills. Furthermore, findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation and learning new technologies as an integral part of digital literacies. In addition, social-emotional statements expressed the development of effective communication and collaboration that enable students to cope with a sense of ownership over learning outcomes, and present different levels of teamwork: sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. Qualitative coding provided a more granulated perspective on perceived learning by differentiating between positive and negative aspects of emotional and social retrospection during the learning process. The findings contribute to educational theory by extending DLF and by providing new insights to the literature on students' perceived learning.

We chose team-based science-writing blogs, a choice grounded in the Self Determination Theory. This theory posits that a sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness are essential requirements to perform a task in an autonomous motivated fashion. Through surveys over a period of four years, we assessed how students perceived the blog project. Qualitative analyses revealed that students recognized and appreciated their autonomy. They also consistently considered as positive a sense of competence, expressed as being useful, and relatedness, i.e. relating with others and working together. A quantitative analysis based on an intrinsic-motivation inventory revealed that students experienced science-writing on the web as an intrinsically motivating learning task.

Yet, children's temperamental regulation and the quality of the early childhood classroom environment have been associated with better academic skills. This study is an examination of prekindergarten classroom quality (instructional support, emotional support, organization) as a moderator between temperamental regulation and early math and literacy skills for children at varying levels of cumulative economic risk. The sample includes children enrolled in Head Start programs drawn from the FACES 2009 study. Three main findings emerged. First, for lower and highest risk children, more instructional support was associated with better math performance when children had high levels of temperamental regulation but poorer performance when children had low temperamental regulation. Second, among highest risk children, low instructional support was protective for math performance for children with low temperamental regulation and detrimental for those with high temperamental regulation. Third, for highest risk children, high classroom organization predicted better literacy scores for those with high temperamental regulation. Children with low temperamental regulation were expected to perform about the same, regardless of the level of classroom organization.

Groups of participants were required to learn the stroke configuration, the stroke order, or the stroke directions of a set of Chinese pseudocharacters. For each learning task, participants were divided into groups receiving dynamic, static-sequential, or static visualizations. An old/new character recognition task was given at test. The results showed that learning both stroke configuration and stroke order was best with static pictures (Experiments 1 and 2), while there was no reliable difference between the groups for learning stroke direction (Experiment 3). An additional experiment, however, revealed that learning with sequential pictures was superior when testing was carried out with sequential pictures, irrespective of the learning task (Experiment 4). The combined evidence from all experiments speaks against task requirements playing a role in determining the effectiveness of a visualization format.

Participants included five cohorts of children who were identified as typical readers (N = 70,493 75,553) or as children with specific reading comprehension difficulties (N = 480 - 8,717). Across cohorts, children with specific reading comprehension difficulties exhibited oral language difficulties based on a measure of vocabulary; however, the observed weakness in vocabulary was not as severe as their reading comprehension difficulties. Results from the regression-based matching technique suggested that the vocabulary weakness for these children is better characterized as a developmental delay rather than a developmental deficit. This outcome also emerged when more stringent criteria were used to identify subgroups of readers. Although children with poor reading comprehension despite adequate decoding have a weakness in at least one aspect of oral language, their oral language weakness does not account for the severity of their reading comprehension difficulties. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Educational Impact and Implications Statement The present investigation examined the reading comprehension and receptive vocabulary skills of five cohorts of children who were identified as having poor reading comprehension despite adequate word reading skills. Across cohorts, children with reading comprehension problems had a weakness in receptive vocabulary knowledge; however, this weakness was less severe than their reading comprehension problem. Results also suggested that the observed vocabulary weakness was developmentally delayed, indicating that it is better characterized as a correlate rather than a cause of children's reading comprehension problems.

An extensive body of studies has found a negative correlation between anxiety and concurrent mathematics achievement. However, prior research on their longitudinal interplay has yielded inconsistent results. Furthermore, the question of how teachers' instructional behavior could reduce anxiety and its negative associations remains open. In this regard, especially teacher sensitivity, that is, teachers' awareness of students' academic difficulties and emotional needs, could be a resource. Therefore, the present study drew on longitudinal data from N = 1,559 secondary school students who completed standardized mathematics achievement tests, reported on their mathematics anxiety in terms of worry and emotionality, and on their mathematics teachers' sensitivity in the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades. To obtain a comprehensive picture, parents also rated their children's anxiety, and report card grades were included as an additional indicator of achievement. The results of latent cross-lagged panel analyses showed reciprocal links between students' mathematics anxiety, in particular their worry, and achievement. Notably, the results were consistent regardless of whether students or parents reported on anxiety. Regarding the question of how to intervene in this process, we found some evidence that teacher sensitivity was associated with decreases in students' mathematics anxiety.

Explanatory item response theory (EIRT) provides an ideal approach to testing this core feature of SCM, as it allows for simultaneous estimation of both item and person effects on problem-solving outcomes. We used EIRT to test and confirm this central tenet of the SCM for adolescents' (n = 376) solving of addition problems.

Operationalizing competition in three different ways we test this in four studies. In Study 1, adherence to benevolence values predicted positive attitudes toward collective but not individual cheating among students presented (vs. not) with a portrayal of society as competitive. Study 2 revealed that, within the competitive context of an end-of-year exam, adherence to benevolence values positively predicted moral disengagement toward collective cheating but negatively predicted individual cheating. Study 3 showed that valuing both being a dependable friend and attaining power and influence, predicted the acceptance of collective cheating. Finally, in Study 4, carried out with dyads of students, groups composed of students who knew each other cheated more than students composed of strangers. Furthermore, dyad adherence to power values positively predicted cheating behavior among dyads that knew (vs. did not know) each other. These results signal that group loyalty can, in certain conditions, lead to justifying and engaging in collective, cheating, and that the motivational underpinnings may be the moral status of benevolence values.";"[Pulfrey, Caroline; Durussel, Kevin; Butera, Fabrizio] Univ Lausanne, Lab Psychol Sociale UNILaPS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland";"Butera, F (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Lab Psychol Sociale UNILaPS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.";"fabrizio.butera@unil.ch";NA;"Butera, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8856-4374";"Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)";"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Results show that the majority of instances functioned to support the collaborative problem-solving process. Further, off-task participation often succeeded in shifting collaborative dynamics after on-task bids to shift dynamics failed.

In this study, we systematically review the literature around the spatial split-attention principle in multimedia learning environments to examine if measures of cognitive load support the theoretical prediction. Our analysis of 41 comparisons found that measures of cognitive load largely do not support the extraneous cognitive load explanation, nor did we find compelling evidence that integrated graphic designs significantly influence any measure of cognitive load compared with spatially distant designs.

From an ecological perspective, our goal was to examine the quantity and quality of knowledge-building supports in these contexts, and their relationship to children's school readiness outcomes. Interactive parent-child tasks were designed to elicit child-directed language in the home, while naturalistic observations in the kindergarten classrooms captured teachers' child-directed language. Children living in concentrated poverty were more likely to experience language of more limited complexity and diversity in both home and kindergarten contexts as compared to children living in borderline communities.

To more thoroughly investigate the influence of prior knowledge on the multimedia signaling effect in a more ecologically valid context, we conducted a quasi-experimental field study with 8th graders. They learned with a digital multimedia textbook in 1 of the 2 versions: (a) a basic version with signals that supported only the selection and organization of information from either text or pictures or (b) an extended version with additional multimedia integration signals to support the integration of information from text and pictures (e.g., color coding, deictic references). Results of a contrast analysis revealed that low-prior-knowledge learners learned better with the extended version compared with the basic version, whereas adding multimedia integration signals was detrimental for learning outcomes of high-prior-knowledge learners. This expertise reversal effect could only partially be explained by cognitive load measures, in that high-prior-knowledge learners had higher extraneous cognitive load in the condition with multimedia integration signals.

We tested a UV intervention in the first semester of a 2-semester introductory biology sequence. For each of 3 units across the semester, students (N = 577) were randomly assigned to receive either a UV writing assignment, in which they explained why course material was useful to them personally, or a control assignment, in which they summarized course material. This fully crossed design tested the effect of UV dosage level (0, 1, 2. or 3 UV assignments) as well as the effect of timing (e.g., UV first, control first). We found that students exposed to any dosage of UV earned higher grades in the course, were more likely to enroll in the second course of the biology sequence, and were less likely to abandon their STEM major than students who did not receive any UV assignments.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of those two paradigms on procedural learning. The effects of the procedure repetition were also studied. Forty-two undergraduate medical students were asked to make 5 stitches, either in an atomized or a delayed manner. The hypothesis was that participants who had learned in an atomized manner would perform better than those who had learned in a delayed manner, because the former approach may have helped them reduce task-related cognitive load. Results show an effect of repetition of the procedure on participants' performance, and confirm the need to examine more than one execution of a procedure when studying procedural learning.

Previous research has mostly focused on its multidimensionality, distinguishing between verbal and mathematical self-concept domains, and only a few studies have examined the factorial structure within specific self-concept domains. The present study aims to extend the scarce evidence of the simultaneous operation of multidimensionality and hierarchy within language self-concepts. Skill-specific (i.e., reading, listening, speaking, and writing) and global self-concept measures for German as students' native language and English and French as students' foreign languages were administered to a sample of 4,257 ninth-grade German students. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated better levels of fit for multidimensional models with highly correlated but separate factors for each skill-specific self-concept compared to unidimensional models. The skill-specific facets could be aggregated into a higher order factor for each language, demonstrating a hierarchical structure. Differential gender effects on the various skill-specific self-concept facets provided further evidence of the multidimensional nature of language self-concepts, although differential relations to skill-specific achievement measures were not found. The high correlation between the higher order and global self-concept factors as well as similar gender effects and relations to achievement supported the notion of the similarity of both constructs. A comparable pattern of results emerged across the 3 languages, but detailed inspection indicated that multidimensionality seems to be more pronounced in the native language domain (German). The findings of the study are discussed regarding their implications for the assessment of language self-concepts and future research on the structure of language self-concepts.";"[Arens, A.

However, when predicting educational outcomes, it is difficult to isolate the influence of automatic word recognition from factors such as processing speed or knowledge of grapheme-phoneme correspondences. Cognitive models suggest automaticity could be achieved in different components of word recognition (e.g., by memorizing familiar words or by tuning the mappings between orthography, phonology or semantics). However, the contributions of each path have not been assessed. This study developed a new measure of automaticity to overcome these limitations and relates automaticity to standard outcomes. Subjects were 58 middle-school students (mean age = 13.2 years +/- 8 months) with average to below-average reading comprehension. To assess automaticity with an accuracy-based measure, backward masking was used: On half the trials, items were presented for 90 ms and replaced by a nonlinguistic mask; on the other half it was presented unmasked to assess children's knowledge of the word. This was instantiated in 3 experimental tasks developed to maximize reliance on different reading mappings. Automaticity, particularly in a task stressing meaning, predicted reading fluency over and above knowledge of the relevant grapheme-phoneme mappings. Automaticity in tasks involving nonwords also predicted fluency, suggesting the possibility of automaticity in orthography to phonology mappings. Variation in automatic word recognition did not predict reading comprehension or decoding. This link between automatic written word recognition and fluency has important implications for how automaticity may be targeted to improve reading outcomes. Educational Impact and Implications Statement This study asked whether the degree to which children recognize written words automatically predicts reading fluency, decoding, and comprehension in low-performing middle-school students. Prior work has not developed measures of automaticity that are independent of factors such as knowledge of the words and letters or general differences in speed of processing. The authors assessed automaticity by briefly presenting a written word and then covering it with a visual mask to force children to process the word rapidly; this is called backward masking. Students' levels of automaticity did not predict their ability to decode words or comprehend what they read; however, performance under masked conditions predicted reading fluency over and above their knowledge of the words and letters. These results suggest that developing automaticity in word recognition may be an important factor in middle-school students' struggles and, thus, a prime target for intervention. Backward masking may offer an innovative way to assess automaticity to identify these students.";"[Roembke, Tanja C.; Hazeltine, Eliot; McMurray, Bob] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, DeLTA Ctr, W311 SSH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Reed, Deborah K.] Univ Iowa, Coll Educ, Iowa Reading Res Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [McMurray, Bob] Univ Iowa, DeLTA Ctr, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA";"Roembke, TC (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, DeLTA Ctr, W311 SSH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.";"tanja-roembke@uiowa.edu";NA;NA;"IES SBIR award [S15C0023]";"We thank Claire Goodwin and Patty Benzing for assistance with data collection; Amy VanHoosier and Eric Soride for assistance with the computer programming.

The present research investigated whether interim testing on initially studied materials enhances the learning of new materials in category learning and examined the metacognitive judgments of such learning. Across the 4 experiments, participants learned the painting styles of various artists, which were divided into 2 separate sections (Sections A and B). They were given an interim test or not on the studied paintings of Section A before moving on to study the paintings of different artists in Section B, and then were given a final test on Section B where participants had to transfer what they had previously learned to new exemplars of the studied artists in Section B. In all experiments, transfer performance on Section B was greater when the participants were given an interim test versus no test. The beneficial effect of interim testing was obtained when the final test was presented in cued-recall (Experiments 1 and 2) and multiple-choice (Experiments 3 and 4) formats. Experiments 3 and 4 also indicated that the forward effect of testing was not due to re-exposure to previously studied items but the testing itself. However, the metacognitive measures provided by the participants did not reflect their actual performance, suggesting that the participants were unaware about the beneficial effects of interim testing.

The capacity to manage one's attention and control one's behavior is commonly measured via direct assessments of executive function (EF). However, to understand how EF skills contribute to academic achievement, it is helpful to investigate how EF manifests in the classroom context and in children's overt behavior. The current study observed 172 kindergarteners for a single school day and captured the total proportion of class time children were off-task in the classroom. This behavior was further classified into specific subtypes to assess whether these categorizations differentially predicted components of EF and academic achievement in first grade. Results indicated that children with lower response inhibition spent statistically significantly more time in one type of off-task behavior (i.e., off-task actively engaging with other materials), and children with lower working memory spent significantly more time in another type of off-task behavior (i.e., off-task passively disengaged). Higher proportion of class time spent off-task passively disengaged in kindergarten further statistically significantly predicted fewer gains in reading comprehension in first grade. These findings illustrate the utility of measuring children's EF in a classroom context, and how fine-grained observation systems can shed light on the specific classroom and child processes that influence learning.";"[Moffett, Lillie; Morrison, Frederick J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, East Hall 3242,530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";"Moffett, L (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, East Hall 3242,530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.";"lillmoff@umich.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;56;1;1;1;1;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

In a randomized pretest-posttest design (N = 95), with a treatment and a control condition, effects of explicit teaching were investigated on students' (a) second-order and strategy knowledge, (b) their epistemological beliefs, and (c) their ability to construct a causal explanation, as well as (d) their topic knowledge, and (e) their individual interest. Results show that students in the experimental group scored significantly higher at the posttest on knowledge of causal-reasoning strategies and second-order concepts (sr(2) =.09), attributed a significantly higher value to criterialist epistemological beliefs (sr(2) =.04), and reported a higher individual interest (sr2 =.02). We found no differences between conditions in the overall quality of students' written explanations. However, the experimental group scored significantly higher on 1 core criterion, that is, the use of second-order language and causal connections (sr(2) =.06).

We focus on the manifestation of two related but distinct approaches to cultural diversity, namely equality and inclusion (i.e., promoting positive intergroup contact) and cultural pluralism (i.e., embracing students' diverse cultural backgrounds as a resource), in the perceived classroom climate. Specifically, we test a model in which the link of cultural diversity climate at school and student outcomes (achievement, academic self-concept and general life satisfaction) is mediated by sense of school belonging, both at the individual and classroom level. Analyses are based on 1,971 students (61% of immigrant background; M-age = 11.53, SDage = 0.73, 52% male) in 88 culturally diverse classrooms in southwest Germany after their first year at secondary school. Individual- and classroom-level results suggest that both perceived equality and inclusion as well as cultural pluralism are positively associated with outcomes and this link is mediated by school belonging.

Using a short-term, longitudinal experimental design in 14 sections of an undergraduate human anatomy laboratory, we contrasted this perspective with the idea that Jigsaw's two-group composition actually elicits a mix of opposing social-psychological processes and outcomes. Supporting this view, students' perceptions of social interdependence and sociocognitive conflict regulation covaried over time with each other and with motivation and achievement. Likewise, rather than solely elicit cooperation, Jigsaw students initially reported higher levels of competition and individualistic efforts than students in a business-as-usual (BAU) control, and lower levels of epistemic regulation. These trends then reversed over time, but the magnitude of increasing cooperation and decreasing competition and individualistic efforts among Jigsaw students never exceeded that of BAU students. In fact, at the end of the semester, the only significant differences between Jigsaw and BAU were for relational regulation and academic achievement. Overall, these findings provide a much more complete but complicated portrait of Jigsaw social psychology and its effects over time, and so doing indicate that theory development is needed to account for mixed-motive situations that simultaneously elicit cooperative, competitive, and individualistic goals and different forms of sociocognitive conflict regulation. For practice, findings also suggest that simply distributing resources among jigsaw group members does not result in optimal outcomes, and consequently Jigsaw must change in ways that strengthen positive interdependence and decrease social comparison. Educational Impact and Implications Statement This study suggests that Jigsaw, a classic peer learning procedure in which students are expected to combine resources and work together cooperatively actually involves a mix cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts as well as social comparison. Thus, even though Jigsaw increased academic achievement compared with a business-as-usual control, this study's overall pattern of results suggests that simply distributing resources among jigsaw group members does not result in optimal outcomes. Instead, it may be more appropriate to think of Jigsaw as a two-group composition that must be modified to increase cooperation and decrease social comparison.";"[Roseth, Cary J.; Lee, You-kyung] Michigan State Univ, Dept Counseling Educ Psychol & Special Educ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Saltarelli, William A.] Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA";"Roseth, CJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, 620 Farm Lane,513C, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.";"croseth@msu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;77;6;6;2;15;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

A posttest was administered after a 6-day delay by reinstating the training materials.

The findings also suggest that more advantaged school attendance areas achieved higher average performance levels in the early stages of primary education despite controlling for student socioeconomic backgrounds.

They are typically measured in classroom settings vis-a-vis self-report surveys about students' goals or the perceived goal structure of the class. Less work has measured how achievement goals naturally emerge in class instruction. We address this gap by examining teacher talk for evidence of different achievement goals and their relation to conceptual math learning. Classrooms with high- and low-growth on a conceptual mathematics assessment were compared for instances of mastery- or performance-focused talk in relation to the framing of the instructional task, student recognition, and student evaluation. Results showed that teachers from high-growth classrooms used more mastery-focused talk for both the framing of the task and student evaluation than teachers from low-growth classrooms. Teachers from low-growth classrooms used more performance-focused talk for the framing of the task than teachers from high-growth classrooms. There were no differences between high- and low-growth classrooms for either mastery or performance student recognition or performance-focused student evaluation.

Although theories of teaching and learning suggest that teacher noncognitive characteristics also impact student outcomes, such characteristics are rarely studied systematically. We propose that the Big Five personality domains of teachers are associated with teacher effectiveness. Furthermore, we test two potential moderators of these relationships: (1) source of teacher personality report (student reports may show stronger effects than teacher self-reports) and (2) frame of reference (contextualized at school personality items for teacher self-reports may show stronger effects than noncontextualized standard personality items). Multilevel regressions were conducted on the data collected from secondary school students (N = 2,082) and their mathematics and English teachers (N = 75). We statistically controlled for student and teacher gender, student previous academic achievement, and student personality. Teacher personality predicted the subjective measures of teacher effectiveness-the strongest predictors were conscientiousness for teacher academic support, agreeableness for teacher personal support, and neuroticism for student performance self-efficacy. Teacher personality did not predict the objective measure (student academic achievement). These effects were moderated by source of personality report but not by frame of reference. The possibility of including personality as part of the initial teacher trainee selection procedure in the future is briefly discussed.";"[Kim, Lisa E.] Univ York, Dept Educ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Dar-Nimrod, Ilan; MacCann, Carolyn] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia";"Kim, LE (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Educ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.";"lisa.kim@york.ac.uk";"Dar-Nimrod, Ilan/AAX-2441-2020; MacCann, Carolyn/H-7590-2013";"Dar-Nimrod, Ilan/0000-0003-2308-3673; MacCann, Carolyn/0000-0001-7789-6368";"Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; University of Sydney's Postgraduate Research Support; Early Career Support Scheme";"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Australian Postgraduate Award and The University of Sydney's Postgraduate Research Support and Early Career Support Scheme.";NA;69;8;8;5;49;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

In the current study, we demonstrate that the 2 sequences impact concept induction differently as they differ in the temporal spacing and the temporal juxtaposition of to-be-learned concept problems, and in the cognitive processes they recruit. Participants studied 6 problems of 3 different statistical concepts, and then were tested on their ability to correctly classify new problems on a final test. Interleaving problems of different to-be-learned concepts, rather than blocking problems by concept, enhanced classification performance, replicating the interleaving effect (Experiment 1). Introducing temporal spacing between successive problems decreased classification performance in the interleaved schedule-consistent with the discriminative-contrast hypothesis that interleaving fosters between-concept comparisons-and increased classification performance in the blocked schedule-consistent with the study-phase retrieval hypothesis that temporal spacing causes forgetting and subsequent retrieval enhances memory (Experiment 2). Temporally juxtaposing problems of concepts 3-at-a-time rather than 1-at-a-time improved overall classification performance, particularly in a blocked schedule-consistent with the commonality-abstraction hypothesis that blocking fosters within-concept comparisons (Experiment 3).

We documented the impact of guidance using pretests, embedded assessments, posttests, logged computer interaction data, and student and teacher interviews. We compared guidance designed to promote knowledge integration to 3 alternatives typically used in middle school classrooms. The knowledge integration guidance was more effective than generic guidance and specific guidance, and as effective as guidance designed by experienced teachers who also participated in professional development that emphasized knowledge integration.

However, research that compares the effects of these 2 types of learning tasks is scarce. Therefore, it is widely unknown whether, and if so under which conditions, the one or the other type of task is better suited to optimizing learning outcomes. We hypothesized that in learning from text, the effects between generative learning and retrieval practice tasks depend on the cohesion and elaboration of the text. To test this prediction, in two 2 x 2-factorial experiments we varied whether university students were prompted to engage in retrieval practice (with vs. without) and generative learning activities (with vs. without) after an initial study phase in which learners read an expository text that was either of high cohesion and elaboration (Experiment 1) or of low cohesion and elaboration (Experiment 2). When the expository text was of high cohesion and elaboration, engaging learners in retrieval practice was beneficial, whereas engaging learners in generative activities was not. By contrast, when the learning material was of low cohesion and elaboration, only engaging learners in generative learning activities was beneficial. Furthermore, in these circumstances engaging learners in generative activities lost its effectiveness when learners were also engaged in retrieval practice. We conclude that generative learning tasks and retrieval practice tasks serve different functions and, thus, differ in the state of learners' mental representations in which they are most beneficial.";"[Roelle, Julian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Philosophy & Educ Res, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Nueckles, Matthias] Univ Freiburg, Dept Educ Sci, Freiburg, Germany";"Roelle, J (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Philosophy & Educ Res, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.";"julian.roelle@ruhr-uni-bochum.de";"Roelle, Julian/AAH-5241-2019";NA;NA;NA;NA;67;6;6;7;15;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Although the BFLPE generalizes across many countries, it varies significantly between countries. The reasons for this variation are still largely unclear. This study investigated how explicit school-level tracking (formal division of students into different school types by achievement) and implicit school-level tracking (informal division of students into schools by social background, controlling for school selectivity) were related to the size of the BFLPE in a sample of 41 countries. BFLPE estimates are based on subject-specific mathematics self-concept as assessed in the 2003 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and reported by Seaton, Marsh, and Craven (2009). Results show that the BFLPE was far more pronounced in countries with earlier explicit school-level tracking whereas implicit school-level tracking did not affect the BFLPE. Surprisingly, the strong relationship between the duration of explicit school-level tracking and the BFLPE was not mediated by the size of between-school achievement variance (BSAV) although BSAV was strongly associated with both types of tracking. Moreover, results based on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 show that the BFLPE is elevated already at 4th grade in early selection countries (i.e., before actual selection). The strong relationship between the duration of explicit school-level tracking and the BFLPE was not evident when the BFLPE was estimated by more general self-concept measures as in PISA 2000 and PISA 2006.";"[Salchegger, Silvia] Fed Inst Educ Res Innovat & Dev Austrian Sch Syst, Dept Educ Stand & Int Assessments, Salzburg, Austria";"Salchegger, S (corresponding author), Bundesinst Bildungsforsch Innovat & Entwicklung O, Salzburg, Austria.";"s.salchegger@bifie.at";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;76;17;17;5;31;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

We tested this hypothesis in an experiment with 428 4th-and 5th-grade students who worked with different versions of an intelligent tutoring system for fractions learning. Results did not show main effects for sense-making or fluency-building support but an interaction effect, such that a combination of sense-making and fluency-building support is most effective in enhancing fractions knowledge. Causal path analysis of log data from the system shows that sense-making support enhances students' benefit from fluency-building support, but fluency-building support does not enhance their benefit from sense-making support. Our results suggest that both understanding of connections and perceptual fluency in connection making are critical aspects of learning of domain knowledge with multiple graphical representations.

To capture those legacies, transformational and influential contributions by educational psychologists to schools and society are described as key themes. Those themes entail: the psychologizing of education, engagement in interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary inquiry, a focus on learning as a core construct, an investment in measurement and an appreciation of human variability, and a search for evidence-based approaches and practices that work. To project forward, those same thematic areas are revisited 25 years from now as the means of speculating on educational psychology's future contributions to schools and society. In both the case of the legacies and progenies, potential difficulties or particular challenges are also considered. Educational Impact and Implications Statement For over 125 years, members of the educational psychology community have made untold contributions to society. In this article, those untold contributions are distilled into five areas of influence that serve as the discipline's enduring legacy: the psychologizing of education; interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary inquiry; learning; individual differences and their measurement; and evidence-based approaches and practices. The article also offers a glimpse into what may well be educational psychology's future contributions, compelled by dramatic changes already on the horizon.";"[Alexander, Patricia A.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";"Alexander, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Human Dev & Quantitat Methodol, Coll Educ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.";"palexand@umd.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;124;7;7;0;33;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Vocabulary was assessed at the end of Grade 2 and reading comprehension at the end of Grade 2 and at the beginning of Grade 3. Cross-lagged analyses showed that earlier morphological awareness predicted later reading comprehension and spelling in both languages and reading fluency in English. The effect of morphological awareness on reading comprehension was not mediated by word reading fluency in either language, but an indirect effect through vocabulary emerged in English. Earlier reading fluency and spelling predicted later morphological awareness before Grade 3 only in English, but morphological awareness began to predict spelling as early as Grade 1 in Greek.

Yet, scant research captures fluctuations in adolescents' daily reading motivation in subject areas or across diverse reading activities: important information for supporting discipline-specific reading performance. Thus, this study captures adolescents' fluctuations in reading motivation within and across classroom environments and explores the ways in which teacher practices may bolster student motivation to read in content-area classrooms. This investigation followed 161 students in 6th through 8th grade in three underresourced middle schools in social studies, English language arts, science, and math classrooms (45 classes) with 14 content-area teachers, across multiple days of instruction. Multilevel modeling results show that capturing dynamic understandings of reading motivation-beyond commonly used context-neutral measures-provides unique insight about the flexibility of motivation to read and specifically how environmental factors can influence students' ups and downs in their levels of reading motivation. Findings demonstrate that students' fluctuations in reading motivation reflect the way in which students interact socially, personally, and materially with reading activities irrespective of the content area of classrooms. These findings provide guidance on how an interactive approach to reading motivation can be integrated into the motivation literature for improving instruction for adolescent readers and extends pedagogical and empirical research on supporting environmentally triggered reading motivations.";"[Neugebauer, Sabina Rak; Gilmour, Allison F.] Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Teaching & Learning, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA";"Neugebauer, SR (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Teaching & Learning, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.";"Sabina.neugebauer@temple.edu";NA;NA;"International Literacy Association's Elva Knight Research Grant; Temple University's Summer Research Grant";"This research was supported by the International Literacy Association's Elva Knight Research Grant and Temple University's Summer Research Grant.

Many training programs exist to develop students' learning skills and they typically achieve small to medium effects on behaviors and performance. However, these programs require large investments of students' and instructors' time and effort, which limits their applicability to large lecture course formats commonly employed in early undergraduate STEM coursework. This study examined whether brief, digital training modules designed to help students apply learning strategies and self-regulated learning principles effectively in their STEM courses can impact students' behaviors and performance in a large biology lecture course. Results indicate that a 2-hr Science of Learning to Learn training had significant effects on students' use of resources for planning, monitoring, and strategy use, and improved scores on quizzes and exams.

Students were assessed on reading comprehension, word reading, listening comprehension, working memory, attention, vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, perspective taking (theory of mind), knowledge-based inference, and comprehension monitoring in Grade 2 and again in Grade 4. Structural equation model results supported the hierarchical relations hypothesis of DIER. When a nonhierarchical, direct relations model was fitted, primarily the upper level skills (i.e., word reading and listening comprehension) were statistically significant. When hierarchical, direct, and indirect relations models were fitted, lower level skills (e.g., working memory, vocabulary) and higher order cognitive skills (e.g., perspective taking) were indirectly related to reading comprehension via multiple pathways, whereas word reading and listening comprehension remained directly related to reading comprehension. Furthermore, the magnitudes of relations varied in Grade 2 versus Grade 4 such that perspective taking (as measured by theory of mind), vocabulary, and working memory had larger effects whereas comprehension monitoring and grammatical knowledge had smaller effects on reading comprehension in Grade 4 than in Grade 2.

Here, we employ a novel method for accurately measuring students' homework activity using smartpen technology. Three cohorts of engineering students in an undergraduate statics course used smartpens to complete their homework problems, thus producing records of their work in the form of timestamped digitized pen strokes. Consistent with the time-on-task hypothesis, there was a strong and consistent positive correlation between course grade and time doing homework as measured by smartpen technology (r = .44), but not between course grade and self-reported time doing homework (r = -.16). Consistent with an updated version of the time-on-task hypothesis, there was a strong correlation between measures of the quality of time spent on homework problems (such as the proportion of ink produced for homework within 24 hr of the deadline) and course grade (r = -.32), and between writing activity (such as the total number of pen strokes on homework) and course grade (r = .49).

The central prediction was that measures of arithmetic fluency for different operations would be differentially related to reading fluency because of variations in the timing and format of arithmetic instruction. Panel data on children's arithmetic fluency and reading fluency performance were collected twice per year in third, fourth, and fifth grades (N = 449). For each operation tested (addition, subtraction, and multiplication), a series of bivariate (reading/arithmetic) latent growth and autoregressive latent trajectory models were constructed. After controlling for background cognitive variables, significant short- and long-term relationships to reading fluency were observed only for multiplication fluency. Specifically, reading fluency in early third grade predicted both immediately subsequent multiplication fluency scores and the slope of growth in multiplication fluency across subsequent grade levels. Exploratory analyses of covariate effects showed that whole number line estimation accuracy was related to growth in multiplication and subtraction fluency, while general verbal ability had a unique relationship to subtraction fluency that was not observed for either addition or multiplication. Overall, results indicate that children's level of reading fluency and differences among arithmetic operations should be considered both when conducting research and when making instructional decisions about how to build students' arithmetic fluency.";"[Rinne, Luke F.; Jordan, Nancy C.] Univ Delaware, Sch Educ, 201 Willard Hall Educ Bldg, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ye, Ai] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Rinne, Luke F.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Child Dev, 51 E River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"Rinne, LF; Jordan, NC (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Educ, 201 Willard Hall Educ Bldg, Newark, DE 19716 USA.";"njordan@udel.edu";NA;NA;"U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education SciencesUS Department of Education [R305B130012]";"This research was supported by Award R305B130012 from the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences.";NA;62;1;1;2;3;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Very few studies, however, have explored how students' attribution-related beliefs influence the causal thought process. The present study used the perceived control of the attribution process (PCAP) model to examine the motivational impact of these beliefs. PCAP consists of 2 subconstructs: perceived control of attributions (PCA), which refers to students' perceived capability to influence attributional thought and awareness of motivational consequences of attributions (AMC), which refers to students' understanding that attributions have behavioral and psychological consequences. We pursued 4 research goals and found evidence to support the following: (a) PCA and AMC are structurally independent beliefs; (b) PCA and AMC are differentially related to motivational outcomes; (c) levels of PCA and AMC vary significantly between controllable and uncontrollable events; and (d) the validity of the PCAP model where PCA and AMC related to cognitive reappraisal strategies, which, in turn, mediated a path toward an adaptive attribution style, autonomy, and subjective well-being. Students who adopted PCA and AMC experienced more favorable motivational outcomes than students who adopted 1 or neither of the beliefs.

Surprisingly little is known, however, about the diverse strategies students use to implement self-control or how well these strategies work. To address these issues, the author conducted a naturalistic investigation of self-control strategies (Study 1) and 2 field experiments (Studies 2 and 3). In Study 1, high school students described the strategies they use to manage interpersonal conflicts, get academic work done, eat healthfully, and manage other everyday self-control challenges. The majority of strategies in these self-nominated incidents as well as in 3 hypothetical academic scenarios (e.g., studying instead of texting friends) were reliably classified using the process model of self-control. As predicted by the process model, students rated strategies deployed early in the impulse-generation process (situation selection, situation modification) as being dramatically more effective than strategies deployed later (attentional deployment, cognitive change, response modulation). In Study 2, high school students randomly assigned to implement situation modification were more likely to meet their academic goals during the following week than students assigned either to implement response modulation or no strategy at all. In Study 3, college students randomly assigned to implement situation modification were also more successful in meeting their academic goals, and this effect was partially mediated by decreased feelings of temptation throughout the week.

With a picture-character mapping task, we found that when no cue was provided, the Japanese and Korean groups used semantic and phonetic radicals equally, whereas the English group preferred semantic radicals. With semantic (or phonetic) cues, all 3 groups showed increased use of semantic (phonetic) radicals, but the English group benefited less from phonetic cues than the Korean group, and the Japanese group benefited more from semantic cues than the other 2 groups.

Current prevention approaches (e.g., the Olweus program) have a mixed record in American schools. We propose a new approach to prevention that leverages theory and research surrounding the social aspects of bullying and victimization, particularly peer relations. Our approach attempts to (a) break down the process of homophily among bullies and (b) provide a mechanism by which socially isolated students can develop new friendships. Our approach asks teachers to increase opportunities for positive peer interaction through carefully structured, group-based learning activities in school (i.e., cooperative learning). We hypothesized that these positive peer interactions would result in reductions in bullying, victimization, perceived stress, and emotional problems, as well as increases in peer relatedness, among more marginalized students. Using a cluster randomized trial with 15 rural middle schools in the Pacific Northwest (N = 1,460 7th-grade students), we found that cooperative learning significantly reduced bullying, victimization, and perceived stress for marginalized students (i.e., moderated effects) and reduced emotional problems and enhanced relatedness for all students (i.e., main effects). Given that cooperative learning has already been shown to enhance student engagement and achievement in prior research, our results demonstrate that cooperative learning should be a permanent, sustainable component of teacher training and school culture. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Our findings indicate that cooperative learning can address many of the social problems in middle school that can give rise to bullying and victimization. Due to its established ability to enhance academic achievement, cooperative learning can be seen as a low-risk, high-reward approach to prevention that should enhance, rather than detract from, academic outcomes. Considering its straightforward implementation and flexibility, we hope that our results contribute to increased interest in cooperative learning as a means to support positive academic, social, and behavioral outcomes simultaneously.";"[Van Ryzin, Mark J.] Oregon Res Inst, 1776 Millrace Dr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Roseth, Cary J.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, E Lansing, MI USA";"Van Ryzin, MJ (corresponding author), Oregon Res Inst, 1776 Millrace Dr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.";"markv@ori.org";NA;NA;"National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R34AA024275]";"Financial support for this project was provided by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Grant R34AA024275 to Mark J.

However, recent findings indicate that hyphenation slows down children's reading already during the first grade (Haikio, Hyona, & Bertram, 2015, 2016). In the present study, it was examined whether this slowdown is indicative of deeper processing and/or more strategic reading. To this end, 2nd grade children (N = 36) read short expository and narrative stories while their eye movements were registered. The presence of syllable boundary cue (SBC) was manipulated; for half of the stories, each word was hyphenated at syllable boundaries whereas the other half included no hyphenation. After each story, story comprehension (SC) was measured by three types of oral questions, namely free recall, cued recall, and true/false questions. With regard to reading behavior, SBC interacted with independently measured reading comprehension scores for both forward and regressive fixation times during first pass sentence reading. Hyphenation slowed down reading of good comprehenders to a larger extent than weaker comprehenders in comparison to nonhyphenated condition, especially for regressive fixation times. With respect to SC, cued recall scores were lower in the hyphenated than in the nonhyphenated condition. There was no effect of SBC in free recall or true/false questions. Hyphenation seems to promote phonological encoding even when readers might want to access words via orthographic codes, which are obscured by hyphenation, especially at the whole-word level. This more piecemeal reading style then makes it harder to integrate the pieces into a bigger whole, affecting not only reading speed but also reading comprehension. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Syllable structure is routinely marked with hyphens (e.g., syl-la-ble) in early Finnish reading instruction. The present study suggests that hyphens slow down 2nd grade children's reading and hinder their reading comprehension. These findings imply that the use of hyphenation in Finnish reading instruction needs to be reconsidered, especially as a one-style-fits-all approach.";"[Haikio, Tuomo; Heikkila, Timo T.; Kaakinen, Johanna K.] Univ Turku, Dept Psychol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; [Kaakinen, Johanna K.] Univ Turku, Turku Inst Adv Studies, Turku, Finland";"Haikio, T (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Psychol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.";"tuilha@utu.fi";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;47;0;0;1;11;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

After pretest, 85 Grade K-3 students were randomly assigned to subtraction, use-10, or drill conditions. The subtraction and use-10 conditions served as an active control and represented regular classroom instruction for each other; the drill condition controlled for the effect of extra practice and represented the direct approach. Each intervention involved 30-min sessions, twice weekly, for 12 weeks. Using pretest scores, mathematics achievement, and age as covariates, mixed-model analyses of covariance revealed that, at posttest at least 2 weeks later, the subtraction group outperformed both comparison groups on progress toward fluency and fluency rate with unpracticed subtraction items. The use-10 group achieved analogous results with unpracticed add-with-8 or -9 combinations.

A series of regression analyses revealed that the handwriting measures altogether significantly contributed to children's spelling performance, with age, nonverbal reasoning, and vocabulary knowledge statistically controlled. Handwriting fluency and Vietnamese copying were unique correlates of spelling even after considering all well-established cognitive measures, including morphological awareness, orthographic awareness, and phonological awareness.

To clarify these inconsistencies we report a 6-year longitudinal study (starting at Age 4 years) where we control for measurement error and track the development and interrelationships between a range of predictors of reading comprehension (language, decoding, and cognitive skills). We found two main pathways to reading comprehension: a highly stable language comprehension pathway (reflecting variations in vocabulary, listening comprehension, grammar, and verbal working memory) and a less stable code-related pathway (reflecting variations in phoneme awareness, letter knowledge, and rapid automatized naming). Early language comprehension at Age 4 years is strongly related to code-related predictors (phoneme awareness, letter knowledge, and rapid naming), and influences decoding indirectly through these constructs. Early oral language skills predicted initial levels of reading comprehension and its growth between the ages of 7 and 9 years. Strikingly, language comprehension and decoding, together with their interaction and curvilinear effects, explain almost all (99.7%) of the variance in reading comprehension skills at 7 years of age.

A sample of 383 children (193 girls) was followed from kindergarten (M-age = 5.50) through Grade 12 (M-age = 17.89), and measures of peer victimization, school engagement, academic self-perceptions, and achievement were repeatedly administered across this epoch. Although it was the norm for victimization prevalence and frequency to decline across formal schooling, 5 trajectory subtypes were identified, capturing differences in victimization frequency and continuity (i.e., highchronic, moderate-emerging, early victims, low victims, and nonvictims). Consistent with a chronic stress hypothesis, high-chronic victimization consistently was related to lower-and often prolongeddisparities in school engagement, academic self-perceptions, and academic achievement. For other victimization subtypes, movement into victimization (i.e., moderate-emerging) was associated with lower or declining scores on academic indicators, and movement out of victimization (i.e., early victims) with higher or increasing scores on these indicators (i.e., recovery).

However. it is unclear whether refutation texts and the conceptual-change processes induced by reading them benefit metacomprehension accuracy in addition to comprehension and how robust these effects are when reading further texts. We conducted an experiment in which we asked 80 student teachers with a varying number of statistical misconceptions to read either a standard or a refutation text on statistics and assessed their comprehension and metacomprehension. In a subsample, we examined the students' conceptual-change processes during reading with the think-aloud methodology. Subsequently, we asked the students to read a research report that required the application of the previously acquired statistical knowledge and assessed their comprehension and metacomprehension again. The results revealed that the refutation text compensated for the detrimental impact of misconceptions on comprehension and metacomprehension accuracy. The think-aloud data indicated that when reading the refutation text. students with more misconceptions engaged in conceptual-change processes more actively, which in turn supported their comprehension and metacomprehension accuracy. Compensatory effects of the refutation text were also found when the students read the research report.

Data from 1,067 German 8th graders were analyzed using multilevel structural equation modeling. Our results showed that students' intelligence was the best unique predictor of standardized test performance in math, but its predictive power for students' test performance in German was comparable with the peck-five effects of students' ability self-concept ill this domain. Students domain-srxicific ability self-concept emerged as the best predictor of students' grades in both math and German. Commonality analyses revealed greater overlap between students' intelligence and self-concept in math than in the verbal domain. Finally, analyses of compositional &acts indicated that having classmates with comparatively high intelligence positively predicted students' standardized test performance in both math and German, controlling for individual intelligence, but did not significantly predict students' grades.

We disentangled achievement, ethnicity and minority status and examined whether the achievement of ethnic minority students is judged according to the predominant expectation (expectation hypothesis) and whether teachers' judgment accuracy is influenced by students' ethnicity or their minority status (ethnicity hypothesis or minority hypothesis). We conducted 4 experimental studies with a computer simulation (the Simulated Classroom). In Studies 1 and 2 with N = 34 and N = 30 participants, we implemented Turkish (Study 1) and Asian students (Study 2) as minorities. In contrast to the expectation hypothesis, the expectations attributed to the achievement of ethnic minority students did not bias teachers' judgments. In both studies we found greater judgment accuracy for ethnic minority students, thereby probing the ethnicity hypothesis. In Study 3 with N = 48 participants, we further disentangled ethnicity and minority using German students as minority students, thus probing the minority hypothesis. Again, minority students were judged more accurately. Implementing gender (male vs. female) as the minority characteristic in Study 4, with N = 52 participants, yielded the same result: Minority students were judged more accurately, therefore supporting the minority hypothesis.

However, no previous research has clearly measured the association between mathematics anxiety and mathematical learning disability. To fill this gap, here we investigated the comorbidity of developmental dyscalculia (a selective, serious deficit in mathematical performance) and mathematics anxiety in a sample of 1,757 primary school (8-to 9-year-old) and secondary school (12-to 13-year-old) children. We found that children with developmental dyscalculia were twice as likely to have high mathematics anxiety as were children with typical mathematics performance. More girls had comorbid mathematics anxiety and developmental dyscalculia than did boys. However, 77% of children with high mathematics anxiety had typical or high mathematics performance. Our findings suggest that cognitive and emotional mathematics problems largely dissociate and call into question the assumption that high mathematics anxiety is exclusively linked to poor mathematics performance.

In the current study, we investigated the longitudinal relations of 2 dimensions of ERI (embedded achievement, and ethnic affirmation and belonging) with achievement approach goal orientations, and we tested whether these relations were mediated by valuing of school among North African French middle school students (N = 336). Adolescents completed surveys annually during the last 3 years of French middle school (Grades 7, 8, and 9). Results of path analyses indicated positive direct effects of Grade 7 embedded achievement on Grade 9 performance-approach goals. Grade 7 ethnic affirmation/belonging negatively predicted Grade 9 performance approach goals. The anticipated indirect effects of Grade 7 embedded achievement and affirmation/belonging on performance and mastery-approach goals via students' Grade 8 reports of valuing of school were nonsignificant. These results clarify ways in which aspects of ERI might have different relations with achievement striving among ethnic/racial minority youth, thereby enriching theorizing vis-a-vis ERI and academic motivation in an understudied population in psychological and educational science.";"[Hoffman, Adam J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kurtz-Costes, Beth] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Loose, Florence] Montpellier Univ, Dept GEA, Montpellier, France; [Loose, Florence] Montpellier Res Management, Dept Human Resources Management, Montpellier, France; [Dumas, Florence] Nimes Univ, Dept Psychol Letters Languages & Hist, Nimes, France; [Smeding, Annique] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Dept Psychol, Chambery, France; [Smeding, Annique] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Dept Psychol, Grenoble, France; [Regner, Isabelle] Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr Social Sci Sci, Marseille, France; [Regner, Isabelle] CNRS, Marseille, France";"Hoffman, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.";"ajho@umich.edu";"Regner, Isabelle/AAE-4826-2020";"Kurtz-Costes, Beth/0000-0003-3026-4413";NA;NA;NA;101;1;1;1;4;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

The present research addressed this question using a website called Feedback Forward through which White undergraduates provided extensive open-ended responses on a poorly written essay supposedly drafted by either a Black or a White fellow student. Results revealed a dissociation between the substance and style of feedback to the Black writer. The Black writer received selectively more overt praise for his or her writing and writing skills, and more encouragement to pursue a writing-related career, replicating past studies of the positive bias. However, this positively biased feedback was conveyed in a selectively more lenient style, marked by a simpler and less analytic vocabulary, more personal pronouns, more positive emotion words, and syntax that more closely mimicked that of the poorly written essay. Discomfort supplying feedback moderated these effects. Increased discomfort was associated with more substantive criticism to the White writer, and with a more lenient style to the Black writer. In sum, minority learners may be receiving open-ended feedback that is a perplexing blend of explicit praise conveyed in an implicitly diminishing manner. Additional results showed that manipulated self-image concerns produced positively biased copyedits to the Black writer, replicating Harber, Stafford, and Kennedy (2010).

The PD system. called DBI-TLC, provided tools for early writing assessment and intervention, learning modules including face-to-face workshops followed by classroom application, and ongoing coaching to support DBI implementation. Special education teachers in 19 classrooms in 2 Midwestern districts were assigned randomly to receive DBI-TLC or to a business-as-usual control group. All teachers completed pre- and posttests of DBI knowledge and skills and self-efficacy, and DBI-TLC teachers' fidelity to DBI was assessed. Fifty-three students (2 to 3 from each classroom) completed pre- and posttests of early writing using curriculum-based measures (CBM) and the Test of Early Written Language-3 (TEWL-3). DBI-TLC teachers outperformed controls at posttest on DBI knowledge and skills (Hedge's g = 2.88) and reported a more explicit writing instruction orientation compared to controls (g = 1.63). DBI fidelity varied (on average. 84% for assessment, 79% for intervention, and 52% for decision-making). Students whose teachers implemented DBI showed a pattern of stronger early writing performance compared to control students on CBM, with effect sizes of 0.23 to 0.40, but not on the TEWL-3 (0.02 to 0.13).

Being young for your grade is associated with lower self-concept, whereas being old for your grade is associated with higher self-concept. We extend this research in several ways. First, we aim to improve causal claims for the NYiSE by utilizing birth month as an instrumental variable. Using the Longitudinal Study of Australian Youth we find that the NYiSE is negative under instrumental variable regression. Given that NYiSE has focused on math self-concept we show that the effect extends to other measures of math, general academic, and English social comparison. Finally, using General Estimating Equations we show that the NYiSE also has an effect on university entry that is explained by self-beliefs. Our research has policy implications around how children enter school. Further, this research shows that the use of alternative causal modeling strategies is a useful asset to educational research especially when randomized control trials are not yet available or feasible. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Research shows that a child's peers are formative in how they view themselves. In this research, we show that this includes the relative age of those peers. We find that children who are older than their peers-and are thus more mature-have a significant self-concept advantage. Furthermore, we find that this self-concept advantage contributes to university entry. When parents, teachers, schools, or policy chooses the peer context for one child they are also helping to determine the context for every other child.

In particular, dimensional comparisons explain the seemingly paradoxical finding, described in the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model, that students' math (verbal) achievement has a negative effect on their verbal (math) self-concept (dimensional comparison effect), while controlling for the positive effect of verbal (math) achievement on verbal (math) self-concept (social comparison effect). The present study is the first to examine awareness of dimensional and social comparisons by testing the I/E model with implicit and explicit self-concepts. Using a sample of 795 students from Germany, we measured students' implicit self-concepts using a go/no-go association task. Students' explicit self-concepts were measured using common rating scales. Overall. we were able to replicate the I/E model relations (negative dimensional comparison effects, positive social comparison effects) with both kinds of self-concept operationalization. suggesting that dimensional and social comparisons are also performed unconsciously. The effects of students' achievements on their explicit self-concepts were usually stronger than those on their implicit self-concepts. However, whereas (in line with prior studies of the I/E model) the dimensional comparison effects were significantly weaker than the social comparison effects in the I/E model with explicit self-concepts, dimensional and social comparison effects were equally strong in the I/E model with implicit self-concepts. This finding emphasizes the relative importance of dimensional comparisons in the process of implicit self-concept formation.";"[Wolff, Fabian; Helm, Friederike; Junge, Fynn; Moeller, Jens] Univ Kiel, Inst Psychol Learning & Instruct, Olshausenstr 75, D-24118 Kiel, Germany";"Wolff, F (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Psychol Learning & Instruct, Olshausenstr 75, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.";"fwolff@ipl.uni-kiel.de";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;134;4;3;1;3;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

In this mixed methods study, middle school students' (N = 1,848) engagement was examined in relation to opportunities to participate in science learning (OtP in science) from 29 schools in the United States. Drawing on the ecological systems and opportunity-propensity frameworks, multilevel structural equation modeling was applied to test the relationship between OtP in science and student engagement, accounting for student (gender, grade, ethnicity) and school (socioeconomic status) factors. Results showed that at the student level, OtP in science was a statistically significant predictor of engagement, and this relationship varied by school. In addition, school SES predicted school-average OtP in science, and there was a statistically significant cross-level interaction for school SES, in that the relationship between OtP in science and engagement was stronger for schools with higher SES. In the qualitative phase, 6 student focus group interviews were analyzed to develop explanatory accounts for the quantitative results. Collaborative hands-on activities, peer-to-peer discourse, and positive teacher and student relationships were identified as social processes that facilitated students' propensity to engage in the science learning opportunities. Factors related to school SES that explain the link between OtP in science and student engagement are also described. Taken together, our findings provide a more complete picture of how students' engagement in science relates to person and context-related factors and hold theoretical and practical implications for the study of engagement in diverse classrooms.";"[Bae, Christine L.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Fdn Educ, 1015 West Main St,Oliver Hall 4052,POB 842020, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Lai, Mark H.

To address this gap, this paper applies Siegrist's (1996) effort-reward imbalance model in a theoretical investigation of student stress. We surveyed Australian university students (N = 2,451) to identify whether discrepancies between efforts expended and rewards obtained influence student-distress outcomes (e.g., withdrawal/departure intentions). More than one-third of the students (37.5%) reported detrimental effort-reward imbalances, and these imbalances positively correlated with burnout and withdrawal intentions. Ultimately, burnout fully mediated the relationship between effort-reward imbalance and withdrawal intentions for both first-year and subsequent-year students. Unexpectedly, student resilience did not moderate these relationships. In light of these results, implications pertaining to the conceptualization and management of student distress and attrition are offered.";"[Williams, Cameron John; Dziurawiec, Suzanne; Heritage, Brody] Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol & Exercise Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia";"Williams, CJ (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol & Exercise Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.";"cameronwilliams93@hotmail.com";"Heritage, Brody/E-7517-2013";"Heritage, Brody/0000-0002-6437-7232; Williams, Cameron/0000-0003-4364-0561";NA;NA;NA;126;4;4;3;22;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

There have been numerous attempts to support this hypothesis by adding a conflict intervention to learning scenarios with weak outcomes. Outcomes have been inconsistent and various methodological difficulties have prevented a decisive test. We present 3 experiments that demonstrate nonmonotonic category change in the absence of any contradictory or falsifying information in a category learning paradigm called recategorization. The results show that direct falsification is not necessary for nonmonotonic learning in this paradigm, and it might in fact slow the learning process. If the results scale up to more complex learning scenarios, theories of conceptual change need to include cognitive processes that predict change even in the absence of conflict or contradiction.

These frameworks are marginalized in mainstream organizational psychology and educational psychology research on psychological safety. Psychological safety is a concept that positions directness as a marker of contextual comfort. In this article, I center Black feminist theories to analyze how Black girls make sense of their own direct speech behaviors, particularly when they do not perceive the context as psychologically safe. My theoretical objective is to read a rubric of psychological safety popular in educational psychology with and against sociolinguistic, literary, and sociological findings on Black girls' direct speech performances. My political objective is to call for more critical collaborations and transdisciplinary approaches that consider the cultural realities and societal conditions that might motivate Black girls' participatory risk and reasons not wholly accounted for in conversations about psychological safety that might move Black girls and women from silence into action.

This problem is particularly pernicious among Black and Latino adolescents who often face cultural stigma that can affect their perceived value of mathematics. The present study used concurrent nested mixed methods to explore this issue in 419 urban Black and Latino adolescents. Structured classroom observations, a computerized cognitive assessment, and surveys were used to examine how teacher math applications (TMAs) and adolescent cognitive flexibility interact to predict students' valuing of mathematics. From a subset of the larger sample (n = 37), semistructured qualitative interviews were used to understand how these adolescents came to view mathematics as a transformative tool in their lives, particularly in the face of cultural stigma. The quantitative results revealed that TMAs were associated with students' value of mathematics. However, these results also illustrated how TMAs interacted with adolescent cognitive flexibility to predict students' growth in valuing mathematics over the school year. The qualitative interviews corroborated the quantitative findings, but also revealed 3 themes that extended the quantitative results, uncovering racialized facets of valuing mathematics. The 3 themes that emerged were: utility orientations, alternative messengers, and resisting stigma and protecting collective identity. Altogether, these results demonstrated the role real-world applications, race, and adolescent cognition can have in urban mathematics classrooms.

In the present quasi-experimental study, we investigated the potential of physics instruction that is enriched with evidence-based cognitively activating methods, such as inventing with contrasting cases or metacognitive questions, to overcome both of these challenges. Four physics teachers in charge of two parallel classes each applied our cognitively activating instruction in one of their classes (CogAct classes). The other classes received regular physics lessons (regular classes) on the same content. The sample consisted of 172 individuals from the advanced track of Swiss secondary school. Controlling for several individual student variables, CogAct classes (N = 87) outperformed regular classes (N = 85) in conceptual understanding at posttest (p < .01, beta = 0.19, 95% CI [0.07, 0.32]) and three months later (p < .05, beta = 0.13, 95% CI [0.00, 0.26]). The CogAct classes' advantage in conceptual understanding was not at the expense of their quantitative problem-solving performance, which even exceeded the quantitative problem-solving performance of the regular classes at posttest (p < .05, beta = 0.14, 95% CI [0.00, 0.28]). In addition, female students with above-average intelligence (PR >75) particularly benefited from CogAct instruction, as indicated by descriptive statistics and the interaction between intelligence and condition in the group of the female students for posttest conceptual understanding (p < .05, beta = 0.88, 95% CI [0.06, 1.69]). We conclude that teachers can successfully be supported in implementing cognitively activating methods that improve their students' conceptual understanding and reduce the gender gap in physics. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Physics instruction has not yet adapted appropriately to the difficulties that otherwise capable students may have with understanding concepts like force or inertia. We integrated several methods of classroom practice, all of which have the potential to help students acquire meaningful knowledge, into a comprehensive teaching unit on Newtonian mechanics. Students taught according to this unit developed a better understanding of central concepts in mechanics than students who were taught by the same teachers in a traditional way. In particular, the group of intelligent female students, who often do not exploit their potential in traditional physics instruction, profited from the teaching unit that focused on conceptual understanding. Our findings show that this method of physics instruction can be successfully implemented by regular in-service teachers, supports the acquisition of meaningful knowledge, and reduces the gender gap in physics.";"[Hofer, Sarah I.] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Educ, Ctr Int Student Assessment ZIB, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schumacher, Ralph; Rubin, Herbert] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, MINT Learning Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland; [Stern, Elsbeth] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Learning & Instruct, Zurich, Switzerland";"Hofer, SI (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Educ, Ctr Int Student Assessment ZIB, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.";"sarah.hofer@tum.de";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;82;4;4;1;15;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Also, when classmates have higher family SES, students had higher reading achievement (suggesting sharing resources), with diminishing marginal returns. When classmates' family SES differed more (more diversity), students with greater past literacy skills had higher reading achievement (Matthew effect).

A distinction was made between peer norms for mastery (i.e., developing competence) and performance (i.e., demonstrating competence) goals. Peer norms were measured in terms of popularity norms (the within-classroom correlation between student achievement goals and popularity) and descriptive norms (the class-level aggregated average achievement goals). As hypothesized, longitudinal social network analyses revealed that achievement goal popularity norms played a role in friendship processes, rather than achievement goal descriptive norms. Specifically, adolescents formed friendships with similarly achieving peers in classrooms with high performance goal popularity norms but not in classrooms with low performance goal popularity norms. Conversely, adolescents remained friends with similarly achieving peers in classrooms with low performance goal popularity norms but not in classrooms with high performance goal popularity norms. Furthermore, friendship influence on achievement took place in classrooms with high mastery goal popularity norms, but not in classrooms with low mastery goal popularity norms. This study indicates that friendship processes regarding achievement depend upon the extent to which certain achievement goals are made salient by virtue of their association with popularity in classrooms. Educational Impact and Implications Statement The salience of achievement goals is known to affect social interactions with peers around academic tasks. In contrast to prior work which has focused on how teachers make different goals salient, the current study focused on the role that popular peers play in making achievement goals salient in the classroom. Results of the current study were consistent with the idea that the goals pursued by popular peers created classroom norms that influenced friendship processes around achievement. In classrooms where popular students endorse performance goals (i.e., demonstrating competence relative to others), adolescents initially select their friends based on similarity in (high) achievement; however, these friendships among high-achieving peers do not hold over time. In classrooms where popular students endorse mastery goals (i.e., developing competence), achievement increases when adolescents have high-achieving friends but decreases when they have low-achieving friends. Teachers need to appreciate and attend to popular peers and their impact on classroom climate, friendship processes and academic achievement in early adolescence.";"[Laninga-Wijnen, Lydia; Harakeh, Zeena; Vollebergh, Wilma A.

In the present study, we used automatic measures from computational linguistic research to analyze 2,928 texts from geography textbooks from four publishers in Germany in terms of their reading demands. We measured a wide range of lexical, syntactic, morphological, and cohesion-related features and developed text classification models for predicting the grade level (Grades 5 to 10) and school track (academic vs. vocational) of the texts using these features. We also tested ten linguistic features that are considered to be particularly important for a reader's understanding. The results provided only partial support for systematic complexification. The text classification models showed accuracy rates that were clearly above chance but with considerable room for improvement.

Moreover, we have yet to discover whether children may move in or out of these subtypes over time. This study set out to identify the subtypes of mathematical difficulties as well as their stability. Using cluster analyses, we discovered 5 distinctive subtypes among children with mathematical difficulties over the first 2 years of elementary school: the number sense deficit subtype, the numerosity coding deficit subtype, the symbolic deficit subtype, the working memory subtype, and a mild difficulty group. These subtypes showed moderate stability. While some subtypes appeared to be somewhat stable over time, some developed into another profile of deficits and still some emerged only at later points in the development. Understanding the cognitive profiles of different subtypes of mathematical difficulties can better help researchers and educators to devise intervention strategies that build on what the children are able to do and improve what they are still struggling.";"[Chan, Winnie Wai Lan; Wong, Terry Tin-Yau] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Room 625,6-F,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Wong, TTY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Room 625,6-F,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.";"terrytywong@gmail.com";NA;NA;"Research Grants Council of Hong KongHong Kong Research Grants Council [28400214]";"This study was funded by Early Career Scheme 28400214 from Research Grants Council of Hong Kong to Winnie Wai Lan Chan.

One factor that has received relatively little research attention, however, is how relational reasoning may be influenced by the representational systems (i.e., verbal or nonverbal) that hold the information about which one is reasoning. Most studies have also focused only on analogical reasoning at the expense of anomaly, antinomy. antithesis, 3 additional forms of relational reasoning. All participants in the current study, 762 undergraduate students, completed shortened versions of the Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR; Alexander, 2012) and verbal Test of Relational Reasoning (vTORR; Alexander. 2015). These 2 tests both measure each of the 4 forms of relational reasoning, but the TORR uses a nonverbal representation system and the vTORR uses a verbal system. Patterns of performance within and between these relational reasoning tests, as well as measures of linguistic and spatial ability, test the hypothesis that representational system adds explanatory value for understanding relational reasoning. Results show that the 4 form framework of relational reasoning is present in the 2 measures, both separately and combined, but representational system exerts a more powerful effect than expected. Use of the shortened measures is also supported through evidence of score reliability and validity.";"[Kottmeyer, Alexa M.; Van Meter, Peggy N.; Cameron, Chelsea E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Cameron, Chelsea E.] Sewickley Acad, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Sewickley, PA USA";"Kottmeyer, AM (corresponding author), Pingree Sch, Dept Math, 537 Highland St, South Hamilton, MA 01982 USA.";"amk420@psu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;64;0;0;3;5;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Their joint contribution to the prediction of early adolescents' school success has not been fully investigated, however. The purpose of this study was to examine U.S. elementary and middle school students' (N = 2,430) grit (assessed as perseverance of effort) and self-efficacy, and their predictive relationship with achievement and teacher-rated motivation and competence in reading and math across one school year. Scalar invariance was found for grit and self-efficacy measures across school level, gender, and SES. Older students and students from lower SES reported significantly lower grit and self-efficacy. Girls reported higher grit and reading self-efficacy. Grit was correlated positively with self-efficacy (.37 <= r <= .66), modestly with teacher ratings in reading and math (.14 <= r <= .25), and weakly or uncorrelated with achievement (.03 <= r <= .13). Self-efficacy was positively related to all outcomes (.21 <= r <= .36). SEM indicated that subject-specific self-efficacy was positively related, and grit weakly or unrelated, to reading and math achievement, controlling for grade level, gender, SES, and prior achievement An examination of competing mediation models revealed that self-efficacy partially or fully mediated the relationship between grit and school outcomes. Conversely, little evidence supported grit as a mediator of self -efficacy's relationship to outcomes. Time-lagged models across one school year confirmed these conclusions. Findings imply that, to improve student performance. teachers should target students' self-efficacy rather than grit.";"[Usher, Ellen L.; Li, Caihong R.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Educ Sch & Counseling Psychol, 249 Dickey Hall, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Butz, Atnanda R.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Inst Sci Educ & Community Engagement, Madison, WI USA; [Rojas, Joanne P.] Univ Kentucky, Human Dev Inst, Lexington, KY 40506 USA";"Usher, EL (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Educ Sch & Counseling Psychol, 249 Dickey Hall, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.";"ellen.usher@uky.edu";NA;"Usher, Ellen/0000-0001-9301-8987";"APA Division 15 Early Career Award";"This work was funded by an APA Division 15 Early Career Award.

Previous small-scale studies found that practice assignments with a greater proportion of interleaved practice produced higher test scores. In the present study, we assessed the efficacy and feasibility of interleaved practice in a naturalistic setting with a large, diverse sample. Each of 54 7th-grade mathematics classes periodically completed interleaved or blocked assignments over a period of 4 months, and then both groups completed an interleaved review assignment. One month later, students took an unannounced test, and the interleaved group outscored the blocked group, 61% versus 38%, d = 0.83.

This paper reports two studies investigating the unique contribution of mental rotation ability to spatial thinking in a STEM discipline. Using authentic disciplinary tasks from chemistry, we show that the difficulty of a spatial disciplinary task varies with the spatial complexity of the stimulus and the axis of rotation regardless of the representation used in the task. We also show that spatial thinking may depend more upon students' developing representational competence in this STEM discipline than spatial ability. These findings suggest that curriculum and assessment designers must more carefully consider how different representations are used in the STEM classroom for both learning and evaluation. We argue that educational interventions that target representational competence may be more effective at supporting spatial thinking in STEM than those that attempt to train generic spatial ability. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Failure and attrition rates in college science courses are disproportionately high. This problem has been attributed, in part, to the observation that science courses routinely require students to reason about complex spatial relationships, such as forces or atoms, that are imperceptible to the naked eye. In these studies, we examined the relative contribution of spatial ability and learned disciplinary skills, such as interpreting scientific diagrams, for predicting achievement on science assessment tasks. We examined how student performance varied on a routine assessment task from chemistry that involves mentally imaging and rotating molecules. The results show that a student's spatial ability is related to performance when the task involves 3-D models, and that the task becomes more difficult if the spatial complexity of the molecule increases or if the molecule is rotated out of the picture plane. The results suggest new instructional strategies for helping students interpret spatial information in scientific diagrams and new design principles for science assessments.";"[Stieff, Mike; Origenes, Andrea; DeSutter, Dane; Banevicius, Lukas; Tabang, Dylan; Cabel, Gervacio] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Stieff, Mike; Origenes, Andrea; DeSutter, Dane] Univ Illinois, Learning Sci Res Inst, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Lira, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Stieff, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.; Stieff, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Learning Sci Res Inst, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.";"mstieff@uic.edu";NA;"Tabang, Dylan Nicholas/0000-0002-2151-3855";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DUE-1102349]";"The research reported here was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DUE-1102349).

Grant and Dweck's framework as a whole accounted for the largest proportion of competence-oriented responses. However, when present-oriented achievement goals were analyzed independently, Midgley et al.' s mastery goals (Grant and Dweck's learning goals) accounted for the overwhelming majority of student responses. Grant and Dweck's ability validation goals were also especially prominent among students subjected to ability grouping (Study 3), demonstrating the effect of the immediate learning environment on the types of achievement goals that students pursue.

Given this pattern of engagement poses problems for both student well-being and their academic outcomes, it is important to examine potential strategies to address this decline. As a growth-oriented strategy, personal best (PB) goal setting may be one viable option to challenge this decline in engagement. Across 3 years of data collection among a sample of N = 368 Australian secondary school students and using latent growth modeling (LGM), we explored 4 ways that PB goal setting may impact engagement: (a) an initiating effect such that initial PB goal setting positively impacts initial engagement; (b) a contemporaneous effect such that PB goal setting at each time point positively predicts engagement at that same time point; (c) an escalating effect such that at each time point PB goal setting has an increasing impact on engagement; and (d) a slope effect such that initial PB goal setting improves the rate of change of engagement (reduces negative slope) over time. Findings confirmed an initiating effect, contemporaneous effect, and escalating effect of PB goal setting on engagement, but not a slope effect. These results suggest that although the developmental decline in engagement seems to be somewhat pervasive during adolescence (i.e., no slope effect), PB goal setting may be a viable strategy to positively impact early levels of engagement (initiating effect), positively impact engagement at any given point in time (contemporaneous effect), and increasingly impact engagement across time (escalating effect). Taken together, this investigation adds to the growth, goal setting, and engagement literatures while showcasing the various ways (and analytical approaches to them) that psychoeducational phenomena can interact and impact one another across time. The findings also provide applied direction for practitioners seeking to assist students through this challenging developmental stage of adolescence.";"[Burns, Emma C.; Martin, Andrew J.; Collie, Rebecca J.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia";"Martin, AJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.";"andrew.martin@unsw.edu.au";NA;"Burns, Emma C/0000-0001-6323-1816; Martin, Andrew/0000-0001-5504-392X";"Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140104294]; New South Wales Institute for Educational Research";"This study was funded by the Australian Research Council (Grant DP140104294) and New South Wales Institute for Educational Research.

In the current study, we examine longitudinal episodes of data from 2,410 middle and high school users of a badged online programming curriculum to test whether there is evidence that learners' perceptions of badges' relevance predict changes in engagement over time; and whether that relationship is equitable with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. We also investigate whether a reciprocal relationship may exist in which engagement predicts relative increases in learners' perceptions of badges as relevant to them. Learners' positive perceptions of badges' relevance predicted rank-order increases in engagement over time. Further, this relationship did not vary by age, sex, or minoritized racial/ethnic status. In addition, higher engagement also predicted upward shifts in perceived badge relevance. These results suggest that learners' subjective evaluations of digital badges are closely related to changes in their engagement with program activities, that badged engagement neither widens nor closes educational equity gaps, and that learners' regard for badges and engagement in program activities may be mutually reinforcing.";"[Higashi, Ross] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Natl Robot Engn Ctr, Ten 40th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA; [Schunn, Christian D.] Univ Pittsburgh, Learning Res & Dev Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA";"Higashi, R (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Natl Robot Engn Ctr, Ten 40th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA.";"rhigashi@cmu.edu";"Schunn, Christian/H-2468-2011";"Schunn, Christian/0000-0003-3589-297X";NA;NA;NA;64;0;0;0;0;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

As this future author, I focus on Alexander's (2018) article and selected developments in our field and more broadly since 2018. Two of the five thematic areas of influence that had established an enduring legacy for the field identified by Alexander are the primary focus: (a) interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary inquiry and (b) evidence-based practice (EBP). The concepts of theoretical integration and theoretical integrationists are discussed in relation to these themes. Early barriers to interdisciplinary approaches, including paradigm wars and a proliferation of false dichotomies, are noted. The emergence of complexity sciences and a complex systems framework for understanding learning and development is discussed, leading to deeper understanding of the unique social and historical context that shaped and informed our work in the second decade of the 21st-century, as well as the multifaceted context we work within today. Given the interwoven nature of the five thematic areas identified by Alexander, however, aspects of the other thematic areas and Alexander's thoughts on the future of educational psychology are also encountered.

Results showed that inference instruction was effective for increasing students' general comprehension, d = 0.58, inferential comprehension, d = 0.68, and literal comprehension, d = 0.28. Although skilled and less skilled readers responded similarly on general and inference outcomes, less skilled readers benefited more on literal outcomes, d = 0.97, than skilled readers, d = 0.06.

Monitoring one's own learning is a prerequisite skill for successful self-regulated learning. However, accurate monitoring has been found to be difficult for adolescents, especially for learning problem-solving tasks such as can be found in math and biology. This study investigated whether a self-explaining strategy, which has been found effective for improving monitoring accuracy in learning from text, can improve monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance in secondary biology education. In 2 experiments, one half of the participants learned to solve biology problems by studying video-modeling examples, and the other one half learned by giving step-by-step self-explanations following the video-modeling examples (Experiment 1) or by following the posttest problem-solving tasks (Experiment 2). Results showed that in contrast to earlier studies, self-explaining did not improve monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness. However, the quality of self-explanations was found to be related to monitoring accuracy and performance. Interestingly, the complexity of the problem-solving tasks affected monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance. These results are discussed in relation to the cognitive demands that monitoring and regulating learning to solve problems combined with self-explaining pose on learners.";"[Baars, Martine; Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Leopold, Claudia] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Teacher Educ, Freiburg, Germany; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Early Start Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";"Baars, M (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.";"baars@fsw.eur.nl";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;69;4;4;1;21;"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC";"WASHINGTON";"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA";"0022-0663";"1939-2176";NA;"J EDUC PSYCHOL";"J.

Qualitative inquiry and rapid, iterative, randomized A/B experiments were conducted with similar to 3,000 participants to inform intervention revisions for this population. Next, 2 experimental evaluations showed that the revised growth mindset intervention was an improvement over previous versions in terms of short-term proxy outcomes (Study 1, N = 7,501), and it improved 9th grade core-course GPA and reduced D/F GPAs for lower achieving students when delivered via the Internet under routine conditions with similar to 95% of students at 10 schools (Study 2, N = 3,676).

The present research examines how a motivational process triggered by a social-psychological intervention propagates benefits over a long period of time and creates an enduring shift in the way people interpret subsequent adversity. During their first or second year of college, 183 Latino and White students completed either a values affirmation intervention or control exercise as part of a laboratory study. In the affirmation intervention, students wrote about a core personal value, an exercise that has been found in previous research to buffer minority students against the stress of being negatively stereotyped in school. This single affirmation improved the college grade point average (GPA) of Latino students over 2 years. Students were re-recruited for a follow-up session near the end of those 2 years. Results indicated that GPA benefits occurred, in part, because the affirmation shifted the way Latino students spontaneously responded to subsequent stressors. In particular, in response to an academic stressor salience task about their end-of-semester requirements, affirmed Latino students spontaneously generated more self-affirming and less self-threatening thoughts and feelings as assessed by an open-ended writing prompt. They also reported having a greater sense of their adequacy as assessed by measures of self-integrity, self-esteem, and hope, as well as higher academic belonging. Discussion centers on how and why motivational processes can trigger effects that persist over surprisingly long periods of time.";"[Brady, Shannon T.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reeves, Stephanie L.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Psychol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Garcia, Julio; Taborsky-Barba, Suzanne; Tomasetti, Sarah; Davis, Eden M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Purdie-Vaughns, Valerie] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cook, Jonathan E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Cohen, Geoffrey L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cohen, Geoffrey L.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tomasetti, Sarah] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Davis, Eden M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA";"Brady, ST (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";"shannonbrady@gmail.com";NA;"Cook, Jonathan/0000-0003-4907-5719";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Spencer Foundation";"Support for this research was provided by grants from National Science Foundation and the Spencer Foundation.

Although this phenomenon is well-known to teachers, parents, and students it has not been investigated empirically. We examined whether children's working memory performance varies systematically from day to day and to which extent fluctuations at faster timescales (i.e., occasions, moments) contribute to daily WM fluctuations in the school context. In an ambulatory assessment study, Grade 3 and Grade 4 students (8 to 11 years old; N = 110) completed WM tasks on smartphones 3 times a day in school and at home for 4 weeks. Results showed substantial within-person fluctuations in children's daily WM performance. Across task conditions, day-to-day, occasion-to-occasion, and moment-to-moment variability accounted for roughly the same extent of observed day-to-day variability with large individual differences in the amount of reliable fluctuations at the different timescales. Grade 3 students were more variable than were Grade 4 students at the faster timescales, more variable WM performance at all timescales was related to lower school achievement, and more day-to-day variability was associated with lower fluid intelligence. These findings build the foundation for research on the antecedents and consequences of children's fluctuating cognitive resources. Theories about cognitive development and learning should consider performance fluctuations across and within days to understand the processes underlying long-term changes. Educational practice may be informed by the substantial WM fluctuations at all timescales and adopt interventions that increase children's attentional focus and self-regulation.";"[Dirk, Judith] German Inst Int Educ Res DIPF, Dept Educ & Human Dev, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany; [Dirk, Judith] Ctr Res Individual Dev & Adapt Educ Children Risk, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmiedek, Florian] German Inst Int Educ Res DIPF, Ctr Res Individual Dev & Adapt Educ Children Risk, Dept Educ & Human Dev, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmiedek, Florian] Goethe Univ, Dept Psychol & Sports Sci, Frankfurt, Germany";"Dirk, J (corresponding author), German Inst Int Educ Res DIPF, Schlossstr 29, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany.";"dirk@dipf.de";NA;NA;"Hessian Initiative for the Development of Scientific and Economic Excellence (LOEWE)";"This research was part of the FLUX project at the IDeA-Center in Frankfurt a.

The percentage of SWDs in teachers' classes was associated with an increase in the odds of turnover after controlling for teacher, classroom, and school characteristics. This association was moderated by special education certification such that there was not an association between the percentage of SWDs in these teachers' classes and their odds of turnover.

Yet, few studies on boundary spanning have appeared in the engineering education literature, suggesting the need for improved theoretical and conceptual foundations to guide empirical studies of boundary spanning in engineering. Purpose To develop a more comprehensive understanding of boundary spanning, this study addresses five research questions: (a) What types of boundaries have been identified as topics of interest? (b) How are boundary spanners and boundary spanning defined? (c) What types of activities and behaviors comprise or have been linked to boundary spanning? (d) What individual competencies and characteristics have been proposed or studied as important for boundary spanning? and (e) What boundary spanning themes are most prominent in studies of engineers and other technical professionals? Scope/Method Using a qualitative systematic review process, we identified and analyzed 72 scholarly papers from multiple disciplines. Multiple reviewers coded each paper using a hybrid deductive-inductive content analysis process to identify key themes related to boundary spanning. Conclusions The analysis resulted in a framework consisting of six boundary types, three types of roles and definitions, and five types of activities. Discussion of boundary spanning competencies was limited in the collected works, and only seven papers exclusively focused on engineers. We conclude by proposing boundary spanning as an important meta-attribute for engineers and a promising lens for investigating engineering practice. We also relate our findings to the engineering education literature and suggest directions for future research.";"[Jesiek, Brent K.] Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 West Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Jesiek, Brent K.] Purdue Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 West Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mazzurco, Andrea] Swinburne Univ Technol, Engn Educ, Engn Practice Acad, John St, Hawthorn, Vic, Australia; [Buswell, Natascha T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Mech & Aerospace Engn, 3232 Engn Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Thompson, Julia D.] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Thompson, Julia D.] San Jose State Univ, Engn Serv Learning Program, Charles W Davidson Coll Engn, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA";"Jesiek, BK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 West Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Jesiek, BK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 West Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.";"bjesiek@purdue.edu; amazzurco@swin.edu.au; nbuswell@uci.edu; julia.thompson@sjsu.edu";NA;"Buswell, Natascha/0000-0001-8503-5787";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1254323]";"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no. 1254323.

Because of students' chronotypes (i.e., preferred time of day to study or work), time of class can influence attendance, which has a strong correlation with students' performance in a course. Purpose/Hypothesis The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between class time, students' attendance including individual and average class attendance, and students' final grades in an active learning course. Design/Method The grade and attendance records of 1,577 first-year engineering (FYE) students enrolled in 15 sections at different times of the day were analyzed using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference and Multi-Level Modeling to identify whether the performance and attendance of students in the early morning sections were significantly different from those in the other sections and to differentiate the individual and class attendance in relation to students' grades. Results Students enrolled in early morning and late Friday afternoon classes had lower attendance and final grades than students in other sections. Class average attendance had a significant relationship with students' grades. Thus, in active learning classes, both an individual student's and classmates' absences have a negative relationship with an individual student's grade. Conclusion FYE students are more likely to miss early morning classes. In a course based on active learning, this lower attendance has a negative relationship with student performance for all students in the class, including the ones who attend the class regularly, suggesting active learning may amplify the negative effects of missing classes.";"[Marbouti, Farshid] San Jose State Univ, Gen Engn, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Shafaat, Ali] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Ulas, Jale] San Jose State Univ, Women Engn, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Diefes-Dux, Heidi A.] Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Marbouti, F (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Gen Engn, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.";"farshid.marbouti@sjsu.edu; ashafaat@aut.ac.ir; jale.ulasmarbouti@sjsu.edu; hdiefes@purdue.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;99;0;0;1;16;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and FabLabs. Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents findings from implementations at five schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student confidence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology (ICT), and exploration and fabrication technologies (EFTs) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student confidence in EFT skills and assesses how that confidence relates to actual task performance. Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The EFT instrument compares students' self-reported confidence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and ICT tools differs from exposure to EFT tools. Conclusion The EFT instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.";"[Blikstein, Paulo] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, 520 Galvez Mall,Room 102,CERAS Bldg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kabayadondo, Zaza] Smith Coll, Design Thinking Initiat, 25A Henshaw Ave, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Martin, Andrew] 390 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fields, Deborah] Utah State Univ, 2830 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA";"Blikstein, P (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, 520 Galvez Mall,Room 102,CERAS Bldg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";"paulob@stanford.edu; zaza.kabayadondo@gmail.com; am1982@stanford.edu; deborah.fields@usu.edu";"wang, xinyi/J-9100-2017";NA;"Google'sMaking & Science Initiative; Lemann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil";"This work was funded by a gift from Google'sMaking & Science Initiative and by the Lemann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil.

Yet, guidance on the specific aspects of size and scale that should be taught and assessed is limited. Purpose This research sought to empirically develop a framework for size and scale conceptualization and provide a blueprint to guide curriculum development and assessment. Design/Methods Through an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, we qualitatively examined 30 teams of 119 first-year engineering students' nanotechnology-based projects to identify concepts beyond those in the literature to create a Size and Scale Framework (SSF). We then created a blueprint with associated learning objectives that can guide curriculum and assessment development. To demonstrate the utility of the SSF blueprint, an SSF-based quiz was developed and studied using classical test theory with 378 first-year engineering students. Results The findings categorized size and scale in terms of eight aspects: Definition, Qualitative Categorical, Qualitative Relational, Qualitative Proportional, Quantitative Absolute, Quantitative Categorical, Quantitative Relational, and Quantitative Proportional. The SSF can be applied as a blueprint for others to develop curriculum and assessment. The SSF-based quiz demonstrated acceptable properties for use with first-year engineering students. Conclusions Development of the SSF-based quiz is an example of how the SSF can be applied to create a classroom quiz to assess students' size and scale knowledge in the context of nanotechnology.";"[Kong, Yi] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Educ, 1 Keji Rd, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Douglas, Kerrie A.; Diefes-Dux, Heidi; Madhavan, Krishna] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, 516 Northwestern Ave,701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Rodgers, Kelsey J.] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Engn Fundamentals Dept, 600 South Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA";"Kong, Y (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Educ, 1 Keji Rd, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China.";"ykong@fjnu.edu.cn; douglask@purdue.edu; rodgerk6@erau.edu; hdiefes@purdue.edu; cm@purdue.edu";NA;"Rodgers, Kelsey/0000-0003-2352-3464; Diefes-Dux, Heidi/0000-0003-3635-1825; Kong, Yi/0000-0002-2817-5852";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF EEC 1227110]";"Our research was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF EEC 1227110 - Network for Computational Nanotechnology Cyberplatform).

Asian Americans are often considered as a homogenous group, despite including over 40 different ethnic subgroups who speak over 300 languages. The immigrant trajectories, cultural experiences, and college completion rates of Asian Americans also vary. Purpose This study compares classroom engagement of Asian American subgroups whose members are undergraduate engineering majors, and next examines the relationship between classroom engagement and grade point averages across subgroups. Design/Method Survey responses from Asian Americans in undergraduate engineering programs at nine campuses in a public research university system were analyzed using quantitative methods to test for measurement invariance in terms of classroom engagement. The classroom engagement was correlated with grade point average, after controlling for prior achievement and student demographics. Results There was evidence of measurement invariance of classroom engagement across Asian American subgroups. Classroom engagement was higher for the East Indian/Pakistani subgroup than the Chinese, Filipino, and Thai subgroups. There was also evidence that classroom engagement was significantly related to grade point average. However, the low effect sizes suggest that these items may not adequately capture classroom engagement. Conclusions Disaggregating data by subgroups provides important information regarding student classroom engagement and academic outcomes.

These developments necessitate a coherent language and conceptual framework to critically engage with questions of qualitative research quality. Purpose/Hypothesis This article advances discussions of qualitative research quality through sharing and analyzing a methodologically diverse, practice-based exploration of research quality in the context of five engineering education research studies. Design/Method As a group of seven engineering education researchers, we drew on the collaborative inquiry method to systematically examine questions of qualitative research quality in our everyday research practice. We used a process-based, theoretical framework for research quality as the anchor for these explorations. Results We constructed five practice explorations spanning grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis, and various forms of narrative inquiry. Examining the individual contributions as a whole yielded four key insights: quality challenges require examination from multiple theoretical lenses; questions of research quality are implicitly infused in research practice; research quality extends beyond the objects, procedures, and products of research to concern the human context and local research setting; and research quality lies at the heart of introducing novices to interpretive research. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential and further need for the engineering education community to advance methodological theory through purposeful and reflective engagement in research practice across the diverse methodological approaches currently being adopted.";"[Walther, Joachim; Sochacka, Nicola W.] Univ Georgia, Coll Engn, 597 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Walther, Joachim; Sochacka, Nicola W.] Univ Georgia, Engn Educ Transformat Inst, 597 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Benson, Lisa C.] Clemson Univ, Engn & Sci Educ, Bioengn, M12 Holtzendorff Hall, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Bumbaco, Amy E.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kellam, Nadia] Arizona State Univ, Polytech Sch, Ira A Fulton Sch Engn, Peralta Hall 330F,7171 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Pawley, Alice L.] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Pawley, Alice L.] Purdue Univ, Women Gender & Sexual Studies Program, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Pawley, Alice L.] Purdue Univ, Div Environm & Ecol Engn, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Phillips, Canek M.

Over 8 years, 3,097 (27%) engineering students participated in one or more STEP activities including a residential college, a student mentoring program, an introductory engineering design course, and a summer bridge camp for first-year students. Purpose: This paper describes the influence of the STEP activities on persistence, while accounting for demographic and academic preparation variables. Design/Method: Data collected over 8 years from first-year engineering students include demographics, academic preparation, participation in STEP activities, and yearly status regarding major and graduation. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple logistic regression determine which factors significantly impact persistence in engineering majors, in STEM majors, and in all majors at LSU. Results: STEP participants have higher persistence levels than nonparticipants by at least 11% in engineering, 9% in STEM, and 5% in all majors at LSU. Gender, ACT math scores, and, in some cases, ethnicity significantly impact persistence. Participation in the residential college, introductory course, and mentoring programs significantly increased persistence in engineering majors, in STEM majors, and at the university, while the summer bridge camp did not show as much influence on persistence overall. Conclusion: STEP was successful at increasing persistence in engineering and STEM majors. Specific STEP activities continue to evolve in the College of Engineering and should continue to reap positive results in the persistence of engineering students.";"[Ikuma, Laura H.; Adio, Oluwakemi; Waggenspack, Warren N.] Louisiana State Univ, Mech & Ind Engn, 3261 Patrick Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Steele, Adrienne] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Dann, Summer] East Baton Rouge Parish Sch, Career & Tech Educ Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA";"Ikuma, LH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Mech & Ind Engn, 3261 Patrick Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.";"likuma@lsu.edu; alopez@lsu.edu; ldann@ebrschools.org; oadio1@lsu.edu; mewagg@lsu.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [STEP 1A 0622524, 1B 1161311]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: STEP 1A 0622524 and 1B 1161311";NA;40;3;3;2;5;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

Purpose/Hypothesis Our study uses the previously developed instrument to evaluate perceived design thinking ability of senior engineering students. We make a cross-sectional comparison of this measure on a national scale. Design/Method We surveyed a national sample of senior engineering students in 2018 and conducted a cross-sectional comparison with results from a 2012 national sample of first-year students who were interested in declaring an engineering major. Two-way analysis of variance tests compared average design thinking scores across sample groups. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to improve the design thinking instrument. Results First-year students who intended to declare an engineering major score significantly higher (2.80) on the design thinking scale than senior engineering students (2.59) with a medium effect size of 0.4. The senior engineering sample performs significantly worse on the feedback seeking and experimentalism instrument items, but significantly better on the integrative thinking and collaboration items. We found no significant differences in perceived design thinking ability among engineering disciplines among senior students. Conclusions Feedback seeking and experimentalism are traits that engineering educators should develop in their students to improve perceived design thinking ability. Incorporation of user-centered design and divergent thinking in the engineering classroom are recommended as avenues to foster feedback seeking and experimentalism. We also offer recommendations to improve the design thinking instrument for future research.";"[Coleman, Emma; Shealy, Tripp] Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 113C Patton Hall,750 Drillfield Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Grohs, Jacob] Virginia Tech, Dept Engn Educ, 375 Goodwin Hall,635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Godwin, Allison] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, 1309 Armstrong Hall,701 West Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, PA 47907 USA";"Coleman, E (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 113C Patton Hall,750 Drillfield Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.";"ece17@vt.edu; tshealy@vt.edu; jrgrohs@vt.edu; godwina@purdue.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EEC-1635534]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: EEC-1635534";NA;53;2;2;5;16;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, at times they have trouble accessing information from these representations due to the way information is encoded in features of the representation. Purpose To describe how students engage with representation features, we explored two research questions: (a) what is the interplay between how concepts are encoded within representations, students' use of those concepts, and how students translate between representations during their problem-solving and (b) how is the interplay described in Research Question 1 similar and different across students in statics versus those in digital logic? Design/Method We synthesized findings from two of our prior research studies using the constant comparative method. We described the effect of representations on students' ability to access and use domain knowledge during problem-solving within and across engineering disciplines. Results We identified three themes that describe how visual representations affect students' reasoning. First, students conflated concepts that were represented using similar features. Second, students consistently failed to use concepts that were not represented with visually salient features. Third, statics students coordinated multiple representations when translating between representations during problem-solving more often than the digital logic students. Conclusions These themes provide possible domain-general pathways for redesigning the notation and representations that we use to teach engineering concepts and suggest future avenues of research to further explore the generality of these findings.";"[Johnson-Glauch, Nicole] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Mat Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Choi, Dong San] Univ Illinois, Elect & Comp Engn, Champaign, IL USA; [Herman, Geoffrey] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Champaign, IL USA";"Johnson-Glauch, N (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Mat Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.";"njohns66@calpoly.edu";NA;"Herman, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9501-2295";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1429348]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1429348";NA;70;0;0;9;9;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

Qualitative researchers have also noted the importance of student agency in persistence through marginalization. Nevertheless, challenges and questions remain in identifying practices which are effective in supporting underrepresented students. Purpose The study applies scholarship from critical theory and narrative as a new resource for approaching and understanding the process of supporting marginalized student agency. Method A longitudinal interview study with a female undergraduate engineering student, Emilia, developed into a way for her to process marginalizing educational experiences and to develop new narratives that expanded her agency. After an in-depth member check, Emilia became a co-author contributing a post hoc account of the impact of these discussions. Results Our analysis indicates that naming one's own oppression and creating narratives that repurpose and resituate stereotypical stories of oppression was a liberatory act for Emilia. We trace three marginalizing themes of the participant's experience that are subverted and resisted through the student co-constructed narrative. Conclusions The paper builds theory for diversity support, suggesting critical theorizing may present a new form of agency not yet represented in the literature. It also points to possible value for student participants from qualitative methodologies exploring student experiences. Finally, it suggests supporting critical theorizing as a potential new orientation for diversity practitioners.";"[Secules, Stephen] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gupta, Ayush] Univ Maryland, AJ Clark Sch Engn, Phys, 1320 Phys Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gupta, Ayush] Univ Maryland, AJ Clark Sch Engn, 1320 Phys Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Elby, Andrew] Univ Maryland, Teaching Learning Policy & Leadership, 2226N Benjamin Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Tanu, Emilia] Univ Maryland, Chem & Biomol Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";"Secules, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.";"secules@uga.edu; ayush@umd.edu; elby@umd.edu; emilia.tanu@setonpartners.org";NA;"Secules, Stephen/0000-0002-3149-2306";NA;NA;NA;56;8;8;0;6;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, successful pedagogies for teachers to use engineering talk in their classrooms are not fully understood. Purpose/Hypothesis This study aims to address this need with the research question: How does a middle school life science teacher use engineering talk during an engineering design-based STEM integration unit? Design/Method This case study examined the talk of a teacher whose students demonstrated high levels of learning in science and engineering throughout a three-year professional development program. Transcripts of whole-class verbal interactions for 18 class periods in the life science-based STEM integration unit were analyzed using a theoretical framework based on the Framework for Quality K-12 Engineering Education. Results The teacher used talk to integrate engineering in a variety of ways, skillfully weaving engineering throughout the unit. He framed lessons around problem scoping, incorporated engineering ideas into scientific verbal interactions, and aligned individual lessons and the overall unit with the engineering design process. He stayed true to the context of the engineering challenge and treated the students as young engineers. Conclusions This teacher's talk helped to integrate engineering with the science and mathematics content of the unit and modeled the practices of informed designers to help students learn engineering in the context of their science classroom. These findings have the potential to improve how educators and curricula developers utilize engineering teacher talk to support STEM integration.";"[Johnston, Amanda C.; Moore, Tamara J.; Guzey, S.

It further evaluated those predictors for consistency throughout the undergraduate engineering program. Design/Method Participants were entering first-year engineering students in 2011 and 2012. Academic aptitude was measured by high school rank and SAT scores. Personality was characterized using the Big Five inventory, which measures the traits of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness. Creativity was assessed using student artifacts on three tasks and a modified creativity questionnaire. Outcome measures were students' persistence and GPA over four years. Multinomic logistic regression and multivariate regression were used to model the relationship between predictor variables and persistence and achievement. Results SAT math, high school rank, and Conscientiousness were predictors of persistence and achievement. Creativity measures did not predict GPA, and creative self-efficacy was negatively related to engineering student persistence in the major.

Changing political dynamics and a surge in activism among the broader science community have only heightened this reality. Yet little published research exists about how engineering students develop both their technical and political identities to affect the broader society. Purpose This study sought to extend and complicate notions of engineering education that grapple with the political preparation of undergraduate students. The research question was the following: In what ways do students majoring in engineering navigate the process of acquiring an attitude of political fluency? Design Case study methodology informed the research design with undergraduate engineering majors serving as the primary unit of analysis. Focus groups involving a total of 20 students and a review of electronic documents were conducted across three institutions in the Northeastern U.S. to produce data for this qualitative study. Results Engineering students described experiencing the following tensions that shaped their political involvement: (a) limited exposure to politically motivating events, (b) privileging private gains while noting aspirational contributions to the public good, and (c) politics positioned at the periphery of engineering. Conclusions Consistent with increased attention to social justice and civic engagement outcomes, political engagement is a critical educational outcome for engineering educators to cultivate.

What developmental outcomes are related to children's engineering thinking? Conclusions The small body of research regarding engineering thinking in prekindergarten children only allows for a few limited conclusions. Specifically, results indicate that children display engineering thinking when actively engaged with materials, adults are better able to facilitate engineering thinking if they have received some guidance on both engineering principles and asking children questions, and children's engineering thinking can promote early math skills and possibly social and emotional development. However, a consistent limitation in the literature is that measures are underdeveloped and their psychometric properties are often unestablished.";"[Lippard, Christine N.] Iowa State Univ, Human Dev & Family Studies, 4380 Palmer Bldg,2222 Osborn Dr,Suite 1354, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lamm, Monica H.] Iowa State Univ, Chem & Biol Engn, 2114 Sweeney Hall,618 Bissell Rd, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ, 4380 Palmer Bldg,2222 Osborn Dr, Ames, IA 50011 USA";"Lippard, CN (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Human Dev & Family Studies, 4380 Palmer Bldg,2222 Osborn Dr,Suite 1354, Ames, IA 50011 USA.";"maynard1@iastate.edu; mhlamm@iastate.edu; klriley@iastate.edu";"Lippard, Christine/P-2784-2018";NA;NA;NA;NA;53;7;8;7;26;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

For that training, the selection of training examples is critical. Purpose This study explored how the characteristics of five example solutions used in training and their associated expert evaluations affected students' abilities to score peer team solutions on a model-eliciting activity (MEA). Design/Method For this training, individual students reviewed a randomly selected example solution to an MEA. They were then asked to compare their review and an expert's review. Students were then assigned a peer team solution to review. An expert later rated the five training examples and 147 team solutions that had been peer reviewed. Differences between the scores assigned by the expert and a student to a training example and a peer team solution were used to compute the student's improvement as reviewer from training to peer review. ANOVA testing with Tukey's post hoc analysis identified differences in improvement based on the training example students saw during training. Results Statistically significant differences were found in the number of errors students made during peer review depending on the quality of the example they reviewed in training. Specifically, a low-quality example and associated expert evaluation resulted in more accurate scoring during peer review. Conclusions While students typically ask to see exemplar solutions, this research suggests that there is likely greater value, for the purpose of training for peer reviewing, in having students see expert evaluations of lower-quality examples.";"[Verleger, Matthew A.; Rodgers, Kelsey J.] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Engn Fundamentals, 600 S Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA; [Diefes-Dux, Heidi A.] Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Verleger, MA (corresponding author), Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Engn Fundamentals, 600 S Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA.";"mverleger@gmail.com; rodgerk6@erau.edu; hdiefes@purdue.edu";NA;"Rodgers, Kelsey/0000-0003-2352-3464; Diefes-Dux, Heidi/0000-0003-3635-1825";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EEC 0835873, EEC 1264005]";"This research was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation (EEC 0835873 and EEC 1264005).

STEM faculty, as influential gatekeepers, can promote gender inclusivity in these fields. Yet, little is known about how faculty construct their responsibilities to advance gender equity. Purpose/Hypothesis We investigated how STEM faculty teaching first-year engineering courses constructed teacher identities and responsibilities. Our research questions included: What discourses do faculty use to construct the meaning of student gender expression in their classroom? How do faculty discursively position themselves in relation to gender equity? What teacher identities and responsibilities do they construct through these discourses? Design/Method Utilizing a feminist, poststructural epistemology and discursive methodology, we analyzed 18 interviews with instructors in three undergraduate engineering programs. After coding data for ways instructors talked about gender in their work with students, we analyzed how faculty constructed their teacher identities in relation to each discourse and how these positions affected their promotion of gender equity. Results Faculty used three dominant discourses to construct student gender expression and teacher identities: gender blindness, gender acknowledgment, and gender intervention. Faculty most frequently utilized discourses acknowledging gender inequity, which often limited their responsibilities to promote equity and highlights the pernicious nature of systemic gender bias. Conclusions Findings suggest that institutions could expand discourse and better align faculty awareness of gender inequity with meaningful, pedagogical change strategies.";"[Blair, Elizabeth E.] Beloit Coll, Educ & Youth Studies, 700 Coll St, Beloit, WI 53511 USA; [Miller, Rebecca B.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 211 Longfellow Hall,Appian Way, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ong, Maria] TERC Inc, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA; [Zastavker, Yevgeniya V.] Franklin W Olin Coll Engn, Phys, Olin Way, Needham, MA 02492 USA";"Blair, EE (corresponding author), Beloit Coll, Educ & Youth Studies, 700 Coll St, Beloit, WI 53511 USA.";"elizabeth_blair@mail.harvard.edu; rbm562@mail.harvard.edu; mia_ong@terc.edu; yevgeniya.zastavker@olin.edu";NA;NA;"NSF/GSE [0624738]; F.

However, ESSCs are relatively recent, and there are gaps in our knowledge about how they are intentionally designed to function alongside engineering curricula. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual model that graphically represents the practices of and intentions behind ESSCs. Design/Method A multi-case study design was used to examine the efforts of six ESSCs housed at four institutions. Using qualitative methods, we collected data from student-support practitioners (those who provide support) and students (those who receive support). The data were analyzed through the development of a logic model. Results The primary result of this study is an empirically based conceptual model, the model of co-curricular support (MCCS), for constructing and evaluating support systems and individual student interventions. The MCCS builds on Tinto's model of institutional departure and demonstrates the breadth of assistance required to comprehensively support undergraduate students at the college level. Conclusions The MCCS indicates how a student's interactions with the academic, social, and professional systems in a college and the larger university system can influence a student's success in an undergraduate degree program. The model combines student-retention theory with student-support practice in a way that can facilitate future collaborations between educational researchers and student-support practitioners.";"[Lee, Walter C.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Enhancement Engn Divers, Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Lee, Walter C.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Enhancement Engn Divers, Res, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Matusovich, Holly M.] Virginia Tech, Grad Programs Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA";"Lee, WC (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Ctr Enhancement Engn Divers, Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.; Lee, WC (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Ctr Enhancement Engn Divers, Res, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.";"walterl@vt.edu; matushm@vt.edu";NA;"Matusovich, Holly/0000-0003-4335-6122";"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)";"We wish to thank Bevlee Watford, Marie Paretti, and Penny Purge for their sustained involvement through this research study.

Compared with the United States and other European Union countries, this underrepresentation is particularly pronounced in the United Kingdom. While existing literature gives insights into factors shaping retention and progression in university engineering students, comparatively less is known about the development of primary and secondary school students' engineering aspirations. Purpose This paper contrasts science and engineering analyses to explore how relationships between background and attitudinal factors and aspirations change across primary and secondary schools. We examine the relative influence of gender on aspirations in both science and engineering. Design/Method We drew on survey data from more than 20,000 English students from the ASPIRES projects. A multilevel regression approach is implemented to test for the effects of gender, ethnicity, and cultural capital on science and engineering aspirations. Results Gender is the main factor related to engineering aspirations, while science aspirations are influenced by a broader range of factors. School-level factors become increasingly important for engineering aspirations. We also report evidence of the early distinctiveness of young women who aspire to engineering in terms of their relatively high self-concept and motivations. Conclusions The association of engineering with masculinity is evident in aspirations from age 10, and students aspiring to engineering are distinctive in several respects. Efforts aimed at improving participation in engineering might more usefully focus on challenging the elitist culture and practices, which may influence student perceptions, rather than focusing on changing student aspirations directly.";"[Moote, Julie; Archer, Louise; DeWitt, Jenifer; MacLeod, Emily] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England";"Moote, J (corresponding author), Room 710,20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.";"j.moote@ucl.ac.uk; l.archer@ucl.ac.uk; j.dewitt@ucl.ac.uk; e.macleod@ucl.ac.uk";NA;"MacLeod, Emily/0000-0002-0666-0056";"Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L002841/2]";"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/L002841/2";NA;81;2;2;4;21;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

There is a need to better understand which individual- and contextual-level factors are related to engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Purpose/Hypothesis This study explores individual and contextual predictors of entrepreneurial intent among undergraduate women and men in engineering and business majors. Entrepreneurial intent is defined as the personal importance that students ascribe to starting a new business or organization. Design/Method The participants included 518 engineering and 471 business undergraduates from 51 U.S. colleges and universities. We examined relationships first by discipline and then by gender in each discipline using regression models with interaction terms. Results Innovation orientation and participation in entrepreneurship activities tied to intent more strongly for engineering students than for business students; in contrast, being at a research institution and selection of novel goals tied to intent more strongly for business students than for their engineering peers. Among engineering students only, being able to switch gears and apply alternative means for reaching one's goal in the face of setbacks was positively related with women's entrepreneurial intent but not with men's. Conclusions Entrepreneurial intent is a function of individual-level characteristics and academic and social contexts, with some degree of discipline-specific effects.

Tinkering contrasts more deliberate activity toward understanding how a phenomenon works. Purpose Some researchers have argued that tinkering is an unproductive engineering design practice because it does not always lead to progress in design and/or conceptual learning while others have argued for tinkering as a productive design practice. We speak to this disagreement regarding the productivity of tinkering for novice designers by closely analyzing tinkering episodes. Design/Method We present a microgenetic account of two tinkering episodes to contribute to a more refined understanding of what tinkering is. The research setting is in a summer camp for high school girls using a design-based Arduino component. Results Our analyses demonstrate that tinkering is neither universally productive nor unproductive in engineering design; we show that tinkering can help participants make progress toward some instructional goals such as supporting the engagement of students in some engineering design practices. We also show that tinkering can hinder progress toward other goals such as developing a robust solution to a design problem.

Despite growing interest in LGBTQ inequality generally, prior research has yet to systematically document day-to-day experiences of inequality in engineering education along LGBTQ status. Purpose/Hypothesis In this article, we use survey data from students enrolled in eight universities to examine LGBTQ inequality in engineering education. Specifically, we explore whether LGBTQ students experience greater marginalization than their classmates, whether their engineering work is more likely to be devalued, and whether they experience more negative health and wellness outcomes. We hypothesize that LGBTQ students experience greater marginalization and devaluation and more negative health and wellness outcomes compared to their non-LGBTQ peers. Data/Method We analyzed novel survey data from 1,729 undergraduate students (141 of whom identify as LGBTQ). enrolled in eight U.S. engineering programs. Results We found that LGBTQ students face greater marginalization, devaluation, and health and wellness issues relative to their peers, and that these health and wellness inequalities are explained in part by LGBTQ students' experiences of marginalization and devaluation in their engineering programs. Furthermore, there is little variation in the climate for LGBTQ students across the eight schools, suggesting that anti-LGBTQ bias may be widespread in engineering education.

Yet there remains a lack of quality tools for assessing global competency among engineers and other technical professionals, including their behavioral tendencies in global work situations. Purpose We introduce development of a situational judgment test (SJT) covering three dimensions of global engineering competency (GEC) in Chinese national/cultural context. The main aim of this article is to describe how the SJT was developed through a systematic multistep process. Secondarily, we explore relationships between SJT performance and other theoretically relevant variables. Methods After generating a large initial pool of SJT scenarios and behavioral response items, we used ratings from subject matter experts (SMEs) to select six SJT scenarios and create scoring keys for 26 response items. To further explore the instrument's validity, we deployed the SJT items, other relevant measures, and a demographic survey to a sample of practicing engineers (n= 400). Results SME ratings provide strong evidence for the content relevance of the GEC-SJT tool. Survey results also suggest positive relationships between SJT performance and Chinese cultural knowledge, age, and years of work experience. However, more validity and reliability evidence is needed before recommending wider use of the instrument.

However, what motivates engineering students to choose entrepreneurial careers and how this could be influenced through education have not been fully explored in the literature. Purpose The study develops and tests an entrepreneurial motivation scale for engineering students. It required providing initial evidence of validity for the scale based on guidelines for developing educational and psychological tests. Design/Method Following a comprehensive literature review, we chose to modify an existing scale and administer it to engineering students. Here we present two sources of evidence of validity for examining how entrepreneurial motivation relates to variables commonly used to measure the impact of entrepreneurship education. They were developed by examining factor structure and psychometric properties as well as conducting mediation analysis. Results Data obtained from 460 engineering students supported three factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation: Motivation for Creation and Solution (MCS), Motivation for Personal Interests (MPS), and Managerial Motivation (MM). MCS and MM effectively explained intention to become an entrepreneur with mediation effects of venturing and technology self-efficacy. Conclusion These findings resulted in a more parsimonious categorization of factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation than identified in prior studies, providing a foundational understanding of entrepreneurial motivation among engineering students.

Purpose/Hypothesis This study investigated the following question: To what extent is spatial ability related to problem-solving among engineering students and how do approaches to problem representation and solution vary with spatial ability level? Design/Method A spatial ability test, a set of math word problems and an accompanying math ability test, was administered to two samples of first-year engineering students in two countries. Data were analyzed at the test level to evaluate the relationship of spatial ability to problem representation and solution. A detailed item level analysis was conducted to compare approach to problem-solving with spatial ability level. Results Spatial ability was found to be significantly related to problem-solving but not to the math ability test, indicating the relationship was limited to the problem representation phase, not the solution phase. Key aspects of representation were identified for each problem to reveal a more pronounced relationship between representation and spatial ability than between problem-solving (representation and solution) and spatial ability. Conclusions Problem-solving can be considered to consist of two cognitively distinct phases: problem representation and problem solution. It was found that spatial ability is significantly related to problem representation but not to problem solution. Hence, this study shows that spatial ability plays a key role in engineering education that is not limited to visualization of imagery but extends to thinking during problem-solving, a nonroutine activity that requires mental representation.";"[Duffy, Gavin; Bowe, Brian] Technol Univ Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Sorby, Sheryl] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH USA";"Duffy, G (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Cent Quad, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland.";"gavin.duffy@tudublin.ie";NA;"Duffy, Gavin/0000-0003-3049-7030";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1818758, DRL-1535307]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: DRL-1818758, DRL-1535307";NA;50;0;0;0;0;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

This pedagogical and theoretical interest is not supported by an empirical understanding of the role empathy plays in students professional formation. Purpose: This study investigated how undergraduate engineering students made sense of empathy during a series of empathic communication modules as part of a mechanical engineering design course. Methodology: Post-module reflections from 146 students were collected in two iterations of the course. The data were qualitatively analyzed using social phenomenology to focus on participants' meaning making in the context of their overall experiences. A model of empathy as interrelated skills, orientations, and ways of being theoretically framed the data gathering and analysis. Findings: Three analytic categories structured the significant variation in students meaning making. (a) Relationships with Others captured students understandings of the relationship with and role of others along the three dimensions of Distance, Difference, and Power. (b) The Act of Learning identified varying degrees of resonance or disconnect between students expectations of engineering learning and the forms of learning encountered in the modules. (c) Empathy as a Conceptual Object described the variation of students' own understandings of the nature and function of empathy in the context of their engineering learning.

Purpose/Hypothesis The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how students respond, via engagement, to their engineering design activities during class. This study hypothesizes that students would experience no self-reported mean changes in topic emotions from their preassessment scores for each engineering design topic and instructional format nor would electrodermal activities (EDA) associate to these topic emotions throughout the design activities. Design/Method Eighty-eight freshmen engineering students completed online pretopic and posttopic emotions surveys for five engineering design activities. A subset of 14-18 participants, the focal point of this study, wore an EDA sensor while completing the surveys and participating in these sessions. Results Preliminary findings suggest that EDA increased for individual and collaborative active learning activities compared to lectures. No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest. At the end of the semester, active learning activities showed higher effect sizes indicating a re-enforcement of students' engagement in the engineering design method activities.

While some studies have shown how various beliefs affect students' abilities to solve problems, studies are needed that explicitly examine the beliefs and assumptions students bring to the problem-solving process. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this qualitative research was to describe students' engineering problem-solving processes and develop a conceptual model that illustrates students' beliefs about problem solving. Our research question was, What beliefs do students have about engineering problem solving? Design/Method We analyzed data from retrospective semistructured interviews carried out after a problem-solving session. We interviewed nine engineering students about the processes they used to solve the problems and the assumptions and beliefs that guided their problem solving. We then used grounded theory to identify and analyze statements from the interviews and to develop a conceptual model of student beliefs. Results The resulting model has five major categories: the problem-solving process itself, the role of classroom problems, the role of workplace problems, personal characteristics that affect problem solving, and resources that assist problem solving. Students identify a sharp distinction between classroom problems and workplace problems. Conclusions Our conceptual model provides an initial framework for understanding how students' beliefs affect their approaches to engineering problems. In contrast to stage models, our model shows that students' epistemic beliefs about problem solving are contextual.

Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore engineering undergraduate student perceptions about graduate study, how these perceptions impact their decisions to pursue graduate study, and whether or how these differ by sex and race/ethnicity. Design/Method We administered a survey about graduate study to 1082 undergraduate engineering students from four US institutions. Student characteristics included sex, race/ethnicity, and year in college. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified factors related to Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT). We created multinomial logistic regression models to predict intention to pursue a master's or PhD degree. Results Identified factors were Self-efficacy, Outcome expectations, Supports, Barriers, and Choice actions. Model fit statistics indicate a strong model. Only Choice actions was not significant. Few sex and race/ethnicity differences held once factors were added to the models. Hispanic students were more than twice as likely to indicate they were planning on enrolling in a master's program relative to no graduate school. Conclusions Self- efficacy most strongly influenced graduate school intention. For every one-unit increase in students' self-efficacy, they were over 8 times more likely to plan to enroll in a master's program and 13 times more likely to enroll in a PhD program, relative to not attending graduate school.

Research on misconceptions can help enhance student learning about semiconductors. Purpose (Hypothesis) This project sought to identify students' misconceptions about three semiconductor phenomena - diffusion, drift, and excitation - and to determine if prior knowledge, knowledge acquired from watching animated simulations, or both were related to students' misconceptions. We hypothesized that students would hold misconceptions about those phenomena and that students' prior knowledge and knowledge acquired from watching animated simulations would be associated with their misconceptions. Design/Method Forty-one engineering students completed an instrument that asked questions about three semiconductor phenomena after the students had observed the animated simulations. Responses were analyzed and coded using two frameworks: misconception and knowledge use. Results Misconceptions were prevalent for all three phenomena. Misconceptions were associated with use of incorrect prior knowledge, a combination of correct or incorrect prior knowledge, and the knowledge acquired from watching the animated simulations alone or in combination with correct and incorrect prior knowledge. Misconceptions indicated a lack of understanding of chemistry and physics concepts. Conclusions Findings indicate that students hold many misconceptions about semiconductor phenomena. These misconceptions were common among our participants. The knowledge acquired from the animated simulations alone or in combination with prior knowledge could reinforce or contribute to misconception formation.

K-12 students need opportunities for this kind of decision making if they are to meet the learning standards for engineering set out in the Next Generation Science Standards. Purpose This qualitative study sought to propose and operationalize a definition of reflective decision-making among elementary students. We investigated how urban elementary students enact reflective decision-making in a formal engineering design curriculum. Method We used naturalistic inquiry methodology and video recorded seven Engineering is Elementary design challenges in four classrooms. Students worked in small teams, and we focused on their planning and redesign phases. Maximum variation sampling, constant comparative analysis, and microethnographic accounts demonstrated the diversity of resources students utilized in their decision making. Results In student discourse, we found evidence for six reflective decision-making elements: articulating multiple solutions, evaluating pros and cons, intentionally selecting a solution, retelling the performance of a solution, analyzing a solution according to evidence, and purposefully choosing improvements. The discourse patterns used to enact these elements both supported and interfered with students' achievement of design goals. Conclusions Our results suggest that during engineering design tasks, young learners working in small teams can respond productively to opportunities to engage in sophisticated discourse. However, further work is needed on tools and strategies that support reflective decision-making by all students during engineering design in elementary school.";"[Wendell, Kristen Bethke] Tufts Univ, Mech Engn, 200 Boston Ave,G-810, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wendell, Kristen Bethke] Tufts Univ, Educ, 200 Boston Ave,G-810, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wright, Christopher G.] Drexel Univ, Educ, 3401 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Paugh, Patricia] Univ Massachusetts, Curriculum & Instruct, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02155 USA";"Wendell, KB (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Mech Engn, 200 Boston Ave,G-810, Medford, MA 02155 USA.; Wendell, KB (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Educ, 200 Boston Ave,G-810, Medford, MA 02155 USA.";"kristen.wendell@tufts.edu; cgw57@drexel.edu; patricia.paugh@umb.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1411660, 1316762]";"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grants 1411660 and 1316762.

Purpose/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that team dynamics in nonflipped and flipped course settings may reveal differences in student perceptions of team conflict, peer assessment, and team member satisfaction as well as possible relationships among these three variables. Design/Method: Students in both nonflipped and flipped settings completed a web-based Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) SMARTER Teamwork survey. A series of ANCOVAs and path analyses were conducted to gain insights into team dynamics in both course environments. Results: Although no significant differences in team conflict were found, significantly higher levels of team member satisfaction and peer assessment rates were detected in the flipped course. The path analysis revealed relationships among team conflict, team member satisfaction, and peer assessment in both course versions. Differences in relationships among the unidimensional levels of team conflict and the other two variables were found between the nonflipped and flipped versions. Conclusions: The primary pedagogical implication of this research points to the affordance of the flipped course setting in providing sufficient time for student members to become cohesive teams.

I investigate a new class of physical models, referred to as Improvable Models, as scaffolds for helping middle school students productively engage in engineering design practices. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this study is to answer two questions: (a) How do students use Improvable Models? and (b) How does the use of Improvable Models as scaffolds support students' design of engineering solutions? Design/Method Design-based research was conducted in a sixth-grade classroom. Students used a type of Improvable Model, specifically the Suboptimal System (SS) seed model. Improvable Models make the entire design space accessible and enable iterative design optimization. An SS seed model represents inefficient design decisions and is used as an initiator for iterative design optimization. The study spanned 10 lessons, each 45 min long, totaling 8 days of instructional activity spread across 1 month. Data sources included student conversations, design work, and presentations. The productive disciplinary engagement framework was used to analyze the data. Results Students used the seed model for productively engaging with five disciplinary practices: decomposing the design challenge into individual design parameters, considering the relationship between design parameters, reasoning through multiple design parameters and making trade-offs, weighing multiple solutions, and using design heuristics for ideation and design optimization. The seed model scaffolded students' productive engagement in various disciplinary practices such as informed decision-making and systematic exploration.

Iterative prototyping and fail-forward mindsets could promote valuable iterative practices and positive reactions to failure, but little research has examined their impact in K-12 contexts. Purpose In two studies, we investigated the effect of a brief prototyping intervention on students' iterative knowledge, desires, and behaviors; self-reported reactions to failure; and performance on a design challenge. Design/Method Study participants included 78 and 89 students in grades five and six, respectively. Students in an iterative prototyping condition (Prototype) were taught the process and fail-forward mindset of iterative prototyping. In a comparative, content-focused condition (Content), students focused on using science and math concepts in design. Results In both studies, Prototype students gained greater knowledge of iterative prototyping, reported a greater desire to iterate, and engaged in more iterative behaviors on a novel, unsupported design challenge than Content students. In Study 2, students in the Prototype condition reported more positive affect and actions in reaction to failure and produced more successful designs than their Content counterparts. However, regardless of condition, students who iterated earlier created more successful designs. Conclusions These studies provide an existence proof that instruction on the iterative prototyping process and mindset can encourage students to try early and often and promote healthier reactions to failure.

The educational system may inadvertently signal to students that engineering is a career choice better suited for those preferring to work with things rather than people. This framing of the profession prompts questions regarding student interests when compared to those of practicing engineers and how such interests become concrete through education and introduction into the profession. Purpose/Hypothesis: We compare engineering students' and practitioners' interest in working with people or things in their environment. We examine gender differences for each sample. Design/Methods: Multiple analysis of variance was used to examine the samples of practicing engineers (n = 339) and first-year engineering students (n = 383). A multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis provides evidence of measurement invariance and justifies the use of the person-thing orientation (PO-TO) scale structure for both samples. Results: Detailed PO values reveal that students' PO scores (n = 383, M = 3.313) are more than one and a half points lower than practicing engineer counterparts examined (n = 339, M = 4.836). However, no significant difference between practicing engineers and students was found for TO. Further, statistically significant differences in PO and TO were found between male and female participants within both samples, students and practicing engineers. Conclusions: Differences detected in PO and TO across the samples suggest possible environmental factors influencing student perspectives of the engineering profession. This condition may inadvertently discourage more diverse students from pursuing engineering.";"[Bairaktarova, Diana N.] Virginia Tech, Dept Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Pilotte, Mary K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Bairaktarova, DN (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.";"dibairak@vt.edu; mpilotte@purdue.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;64;2;2;0;2;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

Purpose This study sought to understand the effect of engineering-centered literature and academic conversations to enhance linguistically diverse kindergarten students' engagement with engineering content. Design/Method A withdrawal single-case study with multiple measures was conducted to document the effects of the literacy-enriched engineering intervention program. The frequencies of three types of engagement were recorded: behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement. Participation in discussions was also recorded to monitor academic conversations. Six female kindergarten students whose first language was not English, representing three ability levels, were targeted for data collection. Results The relative value of the types of engagement and discussion participation increased. These increases generally declined when the intervention was withdrawn. All ability levels showed significant increase during intervention. Engagement peaked during hands-on engineering design activities for all students. A second peak occurred during the engineering picture book read-aloud with active engagement activities. Conclusion The combination of activities in the intervention is effective for English language learners and can improve engagement for all ability levels. Academic conversations enhanced all lessons by increasing discussion participation. Results show a functional relationship between enjoying the learning activities and being motivated to participate in discussion. Taken together, engineering-centered literature and academic conversations are effective tools for broadening meaningful participation in engineering education.";"[Aguirre-Munoz, Zenaida] Texas Tech Univ, Educ, Coll Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Aguirre-Munoz, Zenaida] Texas Tech Univ, Ctr Res Leadership Educ, Coll Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Aguirre-Munoz, Zenaida] Texas Tech Univ, STEM Ctr Outreach Res & Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Pantoya, Michelle L.] Texas Tech Univ, Mech Engn, Whitacre Coll Engn, 2703 7th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA";"Aguirre-Munoz, Z (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Educ, Coll Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.; Aguirre-Munoz, Z (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Ctr Res Leadership Educ, Coll Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.; Aguirre-Munoz, Z (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, STEM Ctr Outreach Res & Educ, 3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.";"z.aguirre@ttu.edu; michelle.pantoya@ttu.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF 1249874, 1463820]";"The authors are grateful for support from the National Science Foundation under grants NSF 1249874 and 1463820.";NA;61;8;9;1;35;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

This article, therefore, examines how the concept of culture is typically operationalized in engineering education and discusses possible reasons for this approach. Purpose/Hypothesis: The specific research question explored here is How is culture conceptualized in engineering education? Design/Method: To examine this previously unasked question, a mixed-methods methodology was developed, one that uses both quantitative and qualitative tools. More specifically, a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of relevant engineering education articles published in leading academic journals between 2000 and 2015 was combined with a close reading of each and a critical discussion of two representative articles. Results: Our findings reveal that, first, intercultural communication has not received the attention it deserves, given the multidisciplinary, diverse, global nature of the engineering profession. Furthermore, when intercultural concerns are discussed, the predominant approach is essentialist, meaning that culture is regarded as given (rather than constructed), framed in terms of differences between nations and potentially offering a causal explanation for individual behavior. This approach has been criticized for reinforcing stereotypical thinking and offering simplistic answers to complex problems. Conclusions: We conclude by exploring reasons for the relatively wide-spread acceptance of the culture-as-given approach in engineering education, then by urging educators to adopt a small culture approach for constructing culture in engineering, and finally by suggesting alternative ways for developing intercultural communicative competence.";"[Handford, Michael] Cardiff Univ, Sch English Commun & Philosophy, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales; [Van Maele, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Engn Technol, Leuven, Belgium; [Matous, Petr] Univ Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Maemura, Yu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Management Res Grp, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan";"Handford, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch English Commun & Philosophy, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.";"handfordm@cardiff.ac.uk; jan.vanmaele@kuleuven.be; petr.matous@sydney.edu.au; maemura@civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp";NA;"Matous, Petr/0000-0002-6140-6843";NA;NA;NA;73;0;0;1;5;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

One's mindset in general may be different from that for a particular domain such as engineering. Having a growth mindset predicts more positive learning outcomes. Purpose We described the general and engineering mindsets of students in fifth-grade U.S. classrooms (ages 10 and 11) who received engineering instruction. We explored how general mindsets may predict engineering learning outcomes and how engineering mindsets may be predicted by general mindset and other variables. Design/Method We collected General Mindset (GM) and Engineering Mindset (EM) surveys from 2,086 fifth graders. We analyzed and correlated their GM and EM scores and survey item responses. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we measured the contribution of GM to models predicting EM and engineering learning outcomes and identified factors that predicted EM. Results Almost three quarters of students who submitted EM surveys agreed with a growth mindset. Students with higher GM scores had higher engineering postassessment scores. Those who had a higher socioeconomic status did not receive special education services, experienced more whole-class discussion and activity, or had a higher GM score were more likely to have a more growth-minded EM score. Conclusions Engineering education should help students see that they can grow in their capacities to engineer. Instructional interventions may positively impact mindset, which could be particularly important for some students. Engineering design may encourage an especially growth-minded approach to failure experiences.";"[Lottero-Perdue, Pamela S.] Towson Univ, Dept Phys Astron & Geosci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Lachapelle, Cathy P.] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA USA";"Lottero-Perdue, PS (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Dept Phys Astron & Geosci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.";"plottero@towson.edu; lachapca@bc.edu";NA;NA;"National Science Foundation Discovery Research K-12 Program [1220305]";"National Science Foundation Discovery Research K-12 Program, Grant/Award Number: 1220305";NA;50;0;0;0;0;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

The aim of IEE is to train engineering students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. Purpose We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses. This aim leads to two research questions: What aspects of vision, teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical studies of IEE? What points of attention regarding vision, teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as supporting or challenging IEE? Scope/Method Ninety-nine studies published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis across studies. The procedure included formulation of research questions, searching and screening of studies according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics, appraisal, and synthesis of results. Conclusions Challenges exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore, there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the development of engineering programs designed to support interdisciplinarity (support).";"[Van den Beemt, Antoine; Van de Ven, Anne] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [MacLeod, Miles; Van der Veen, Jan; van Baalen, Sophie; Boon, Mieke] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; [Klaassen, Renate] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands";"Van den Beemt, A (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven Sch Educ, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.";"a.a.j.v.d.beemt@tue.nl";NA;NA;"4TU/Centre for Engineering Education";"4TU/Centre for Engineering Education";NA;146;0;0;4;4;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, such practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring the job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed to investigate how job demands, job control, and social support affect interns' use of different learning strategies. Method The study utilized data collected from a sample of engineering students (n = 118) who completed a required internship during their degree. The data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach including latent factors. Results Job demands were found to be a relevant and significant driver of students' shared regulation (e.g., asking for feedback), self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use of codified information), efforts to relate theory to practice (e.g., connecting workplace experience with theoretical knowledge), and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g., lack of adaptation to work situations), but not of external regulation (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job control, however, was not found to be a positive or significant driver of student learning. Social support was found to be a relevant and significant predictor of external and shared regulation but not of the other learning activities. Conclusions This study provided mixed findings regarding key hypotheses central to the JDCS model, generating rather poor evidence supporting it. In fact, job demands, job control, and social support exhibited much less explanatory power than expected for engineering students' learning during internships.";"[Goner, Michael] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ & Business Educ, Bamberg, Germany; [Goner, Michael; Harteis, Christian] Univ Paderborn, Inst Educ Sci, Dept Educ Management & Res Further Educ, Paderborn, Germany; [Gijbels, David; Donche, Vincent] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Training & Educ, EduBROn Res Grp, Antwerp, Belgium";"Goner, M (corresponding author), Univ Paderborn, Inst Educ Sci, Warburger Str 100, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany.";"michael.goller@uni-paderborn.de; christian.harteis@upb.de; david.gijbels@uantwerpen.be; vincent.donche@uantwerpen.be";"Harteis, Christian/AAF-5151-2020; Donche, Vincent/R-5757-2016";"Harteis, Christian/0000-0002-3570-7626; Donche, Vincent/0000-0002-9405-3896";NA;NA;NA;88;1;1;2;3;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, successful teamwork is challenging, and empirical studies with adolescents concerning how the collaboration quality of team members is related to team performance are limited. Purpose/HypothesisThis study investigated the relationship between team collaboration quality and team performance in a robotics competition using multiple measures of team performance, including both objective task performance and expert judge evaluations, on a diverse set of supporting performance dimensions. Design/MethodData included Table Score, Robot Design, Research Project, Core Values, and Collaboration Quality scores for 366 youths on 61 K-8 robotics teams that participated in a FIRST LEGO League Championship. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the relation between effective team collaboration and team performance. Furthermore, analysis of variance was conducted to explore the relationship between Collaboration Quality and team experience. ResultsCollaboration Quality was a good predictor of robotics team performance across all measures (with R-2=.50 and p<.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the Robot Design acted as a full mediator for the predictive effect of Collaboration Quality on the Table Score. In addition, the cumulative amount of team experience was significantly related to Collaboration Quality.

Method We conducted emergent lexical coding on a cohort of 187 students' textual responses as they completed the IVL in a studio setting. We then analyzed the discursive and technology interactions of four students from different groups using video recordings. Results Coding results show distributions of students' activated resources. Almost all of the students demonstrated productive ideas, and almost all also revealed opportunities to learn more. Through the detailed studies, we illustrate the moment-by-moment interactions of students with one another and with technology to describe how they activate and share resources. These interactions are conceptualized and illustrated through the construct of shared resources. We relate shared resources to processes of knowledge co-construction and knowledge transfer, and discuss implications for instructional practice and educational technology design. Conclusions The resources framework helps us recognize productive ideas in students' evolving understanding of thermodynamic work Shared resources allows for elaboration of the interwoven cognitive and social aspects of learning.";"[Cao, Ying; Koretsky, Milo D.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Chem Biol & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA";"Cao, Y (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Chem Biol & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.";"caoyin@oregonstate.edu; milo.koretsky@oregonstate.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [TUES 1245482]";"We gratefully acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation under the grant TUES 1245482.

However, these constructs have often been studied separately, despite theorized and demonstrated connections between students' identity and motivation in other fields. Purpose/Hypothesis Our study fills this gap by investigating the connections between identity and motivation. We specifically examined the connections between students' engineering role identity and future-time perspective (FTP; a theory of human motivation) theories to understand students' interest in choosing an engineering major after their first year, which we call continuing engineering major interest. Design/Methods The data came from a questionnaire distributed during Fall 2015 (n = 2,879). Structural equation modeling was used to understand the connections between the latent factors of engineering role identity and FTP. We also examined the predictive validity of this model on students' continuing engineering major interest. Results Our results show connections between students' engineering role identity and the domain-specific constructs of FTP. Identity was fully mediated by students' FTPs, and these perspectives were important for predicting continuing major interest. Engineering role identity measures explained a combined 69% of the variance in the FTP measures, and engineering role identity and FTP measures together explained 14.2% of the variance in engineering major interest. Conclusions These findings provide empirical evidence for linking identity and motivation in studies of engineering students' career pathways. The results of this work inform how theories of identity and motivation can be used collectively in engineering education research.";"[Godwin, Allison] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Kirn, Adam] Univ Nevada, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA";"Godwin, A (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.";"godwina@purdue.edu";NA;"Godwin, Allison/0000-0002-0741-3356; Kirn, Adam/0000-0001-6344-5072";"Division of Engineering Education and Centers [1428523, 1428689]";"Division of Engineering Education and Centers, Grant/Award Numbers: 1428523, 1428689";NA;120;0;0;7;7;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, contrary to the culturally responsive literature addressing approaches to colorblindness, engineering faculty believe they should treat all students equally. Purpose This study explored conceptions of equity and privilege present within the culture of engineering education, particularly the White male population. Method This longitudinal qualitative study investigated the experiences of one longtime engineering professor, an insider to the culture of engineering confronted with conceptions of his own privilege. We analyzed interview, focus group, and field note data to evaluate shifts in our participant's perspective while he was enrolled in a doctoral program that challenged his views of race, privilege, and equity. Results Our participant was initially opposed to conceptions of his own privilege. Through repeated challenges to his beliefs about privilege coupled with reflections on his experiences and positioning in society, his beliefs shifted toward recognizing inequities based on class and race. Conclusions In a discipline with an overrepresentation of White men, there can be resistance to addressing topics of equity and privilege.

Designing self-efficacy measures to assess the multifaceted skills required of engineers could improve the predictive relationship between efficacy beliefs and performance. Purpose This study evaluates the factor structure, validity, and reliability of general and skill-specific engineering self-efficacy measures created for use with undergraduate engineering students. Design/Method Self-efficacy items used for the measures were created and adapted from those used previously. Survey responses were collected from engineering students attending two southeastern universities. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to determine factor structure. Multiple regression analyses examined the relationship between engineering self-efficacy and academic achievement and intent to persist in engineering, both uniquely and when considering other motivation variables. Results Factor analysis results suggested two self-efficacy scales. The General Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale is unidimensional; the Engineering Skills Self-Efficacy Scale is multidimensional with three factors representing experimental skills, tinkering skills, and design. General engineering self-efficacy predicted academic achievement, even when prior achievement was controlled. Students' intrinsic value in engineering predicted their intentions to persist in the engineering profession. Conclusions We found evidence for the reliability, validity, and predictive utility of the engineering self-efficacy scales. These scales can be used to assess undergraduate students' beliefs in their capabilities to perform tasks in their coursework and future roles as engineers and to investigate the association between self-efficacy and academic outcomes of interest.";"[Mamaril, Natasha A.] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Mamaril, Natasha A.] Univ Illinois, Coll Engn, Undergrad Res, 1308 West Green St,MC 272, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Usher, Ellen L.] Univ Kentucky, Educ psychol, 249 Dickey Hall, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Li, Caihong R.] Univ Kentucky, Educ psychol, 237 Dickey Hall, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Economy, D.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how engineering students enter the engineering field by comparing commonalities across their experiences. Given recent literature that describes student dissatisfaction toward, misinformation about, and attrition in engineering programs, we explore the lived experiences of students entering the engineering field, with a particular focus on students changing their majors to engineering. Methods This paper synthesizes the stories of 21 undergraduate engineering students from a southeastern research university, 15 of whom began their undergraduate program in other majors and transferred into engineering. We employ a unique narrative structuralizing scheme based on Campbell's hero's journey and use the metaphor of the beginning of the journey to understand student trajectories that locate students in engineering studies. Conclusions With this information, we can better understand student conceptions of the engineering field when they enter; who enters the engineering field and why; how students' expectations are met or not in engineering programs; and what are the factors that ultimately contribute to first-year retention in engineering programs. In general, students entering engineering tend to have a limited understanding of what is entailed in an engineering program and benefit from interactions with advisors, teachers, and peers in the field. Such interactions may help students to more clearly decide what aspects of engineering are appropriate for them to pursue and help them to persist as they begin coursework.";"[Cruz, Joshua] Texas Tech Univ, Curriculum & Instruct Program, 322 Educ Bldg,3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79413 USA; [Kellam, Nadia] Arizona State Univ, Polytech Sch, Ira A Fulton Sch Engn, Peralta Hall 330F,7171 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA";"Cruz, J (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Curriculum & Instruct Program, 322 Educ Bldg,3008 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79413 USA.";"joshua.cruz@ttu.edu; nadia.kellam@asu.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1160350, 1541358]";"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers 1160350 and 1541358.

This article reports on collaboration between a university engineer and science teacher educators to introduce engineering career awareness in elementary classrooms. The resulting elementary school curriculum, Engineering is Everywhere, features video instruction by the engineer, a teacher activity guide, and a materials kit. Purpose/Research Questions Our research question was, How might engineers and educators best collaborate in elementary engineering outreach efforts? We co-developed curricula, prepared classroom teachers, and compared fifth-grade student learning outcomes to determine the most beneficial type of engineer instruction. Design/Method A quasi-experimental research design assessed the effectiveness of three instructional formats: engineer-led, engineer-visit, and engineer-video. Pre- and post-tests captured changes in fifth-grade students' understanding about the work of engineers and attitudes about engineering. Results Findings indicated significant gains in all students' understanding, with some differences across the three instructional formats. The engineer-led students did not show significant changes in overall engineering attitudes. Only the engineer-video students demonstrated significant gains in engineering job interests. Conclusions A qualitative comparison of the costs and benefits of each instructional format raised important considerations for planning engineer outreach. We recommend that engineers collaborate with science teacher educators in the design of video instruction and assist in preparing elementary classroom teachers to administer the lesson activities.";"[Colston, Nicole] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Geog, 422 Murray Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Ley, M.

However, engineering educators have not widely adopted a framework for preparing engineering students to analyze ethical issues. Purpose/Hypothesis: We developed and tested an approach for enhancing the ethical reasoning of engineering students. This approach integrates reflexive principlism, an ethical reasoning approach, within a structured learning framework, scaffolded, interactive, and reflective analysis, or SIRA. We hypothesized that students' ethical reasoning abilities and empathic perspective-taking tendencies would increase. Design/Method: We implemented and tested the integrated approach over five semesters with graduate-level engineering students through a quasi-experimental, controlled research design. We measured changes in ethical reasoning using the Engineering Ethical Reasoning Instrument (EERI) and the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT2) and empathic tendencies using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). We examined relationships among measures through correlation analysis. Results: The EERI instrumentation indicated that the approach significantly increased the ethical reasoning abilities of graduate-level engineering students. However, the DIT2 findings did not indicate change. The IRI indicated perspective-taking tendencies were enhanced and personal distress tendencies were reduced. Postcourse correlational data indicated moderate relationships between perspective-taking and ethical reasoning as measured by the IRI and the EERI indexes. Conclusions: This study provides a theoretical approach for developing ethical reasoning and empathic perspective-taking among graduate-level engineering students.

Design/Method We used a collaborative inquiry approach to examine such ethically important moments that emerged in two of our interpretive research projects. We drew on Walther, Sochacka, and Kellam's framework for interpretive research quality as the departure point for our shared sense-making process. Results Our explorations revealed two insights that connect research ethics to research quality in novel ways. First, we found that the quality of our work improved when we critically explored the intersections between our motivations and intentions for investigating particular research topics and broader cultural agendas and assumptions. Second, we found that when we actively sought to do justice to the participants, co-investigators, and readers of our research, we were afforded with opportunities to increase the quality of our work, in sometimes quite unexpected ways.

This trend may have implications both for the design of interventions to improve student learning and for data analysis to detect collaborative cheating. Purpose/Hypothesis We hypothesize that average exam scores decline over the exam period primarily due to self-selection effects, where weaker students tend to choose exam times later in the exam period, while stronger students are more likely to choose earlier times. Design/Method We collected 31,673 exam records over four semesters from six undergraduate engineering and computing courses that had both synchronous exams (all students at the same time) and asynchronous exams (students choose a time). We analyzed student exam time choice and asynchronous exam scores, using synchronous exam scores in the same course as a control variable. Results We find that students with lower scores on synchronous exams generally elect to take asynchronous exams later and that controlling for student ability (via synchronous exams) removes 70% of the decline observed in average asynchronous exam scores over the exam period but does not eliminate the downward trend with time. Conclusions We conclude that self-selection effects are primarily responsible for exam score declines over time, that exam time selection is unlikely to be a useful target for interventions to improve performance, and that there is no evidence for widespread collaborative cheating in the dataset used in this research.";"[Chen, Binglin; West, Matthew; Zilles, Craig] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";"Chen, BL (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Thomas M Siebel Ctr Comp Sci, 201 North Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.";"chen386@illinois.edu";"/A-7398-2012";"/0000-0002-7605-0050";"College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP); NSF CMMINational Science Foundation (NSF) [1150490]; NSF DUENational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [1347722]";"College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP); NSF CMMI, Grant/Award Number: 1150490; NSF DUE, Grant/Award Number: 1347722";NA;68;0;0;2;11;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

PurposeThis study investigated the relationship between engineering students' approach to solving an open-ended homework problem and their epistemic motivation, engineering epistemic beliefs, and epistemic cognition. MethodsThe initial quantitative phase of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study employed a k-means cluster analysis to identify homogenous subgroups of biomedical engineering students based on their epistemic beliefs and epistemic motivation measured using a survey (n = 50). Eighteen of these students were interviewed to explore their epistemic cognitions when solving an open-ended homework problem. Transcripts were analyzed and results were overlaid with the clusters to investigate relationships between students' approaches to problem solving and their epistemic beliefs, motivation, and cognition. ResultsThree clusters of students were identified based on three constructs of epistemic beliefs and epistemic motivation: source of engineering knowledge, certainty of engineering knowledge, and closed-mindedness. Students in the same cluster activated similar components of epistemic cognition, such as their desired outcomes for solving the problem. Additionally, we identified that the instructor's description of the problem and how the assignment was structured influenced how students approached solving the problem. ConclusionsComparison of clusters revealed that having more constructivist epistemic beliefs does not guarantee that students will set epistemic aims or make epistemic gains. Additionally, students' approaches to solving the open-ended problem were influenced by their lack of desire to consider other ideas. The outcomes of this study provide a more complete understanding of students' epistemic cognitions and beliefs related to problem solving in the classroom.";"[Faber, Courtney] Univ Tennessee, Tickle Coll Engn, Cook Grand Challenges Honors Program, Perkins Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Benson, Lisa C.] Clemson Univ, Engn & Sci Educ, Holtzendorff Hall, Clemson, SC 29631 USA";"Faber, C (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Tickle Coll Engn, Cook Grand Challenges Honors Program, Perkins Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.";"cfaber2@utk.edu; lbenson@clemson.edu";NA;"Faber, Courtney/0000-0001-9156-7616";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1246875, EEC- 1055950]";"We wish to thank Catherine McGough, Aubrie Pfirman, and Gustavo Moran-Soto who helped collect interview data and review coded transcripts, and Dennis Lee for reviewing the final manuscript.

Purpose With the goal of designing effective learning environments, this study identifies qualitatively different ways that engineering students experienced ill-structured problems while working in teams. Design/Method This phenomenographic study employs interview data from 27 first-year engineering students. Iterative data analysis resulted in categories of student experiences and their logical relationships. Results Seven categories describing collaborative, ill-structured problem-solving experiences emerged: completion, transition, iteration, organization, collaboration, reasoning, and growth. These categories are organized in an outcome space along dimensions we call reaction to ambiguity and use of multiple perspectives that can be used to frame students' perspectives from less comprehensive to more comprehensive. Conclusions First-year engineering students experience team-based, ill-structured problem solving in a variety of ways. The resulting outcome space is of practical use to educators who teach courses involving collaborative, ill-structured problem solving.";"[Dringenberg, Emily] Ohio State Univ, Dept Engn Educ, 2070 Neil Ave,203 Hitchcock, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Purzer, Senay] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, 516 Northwestern Ave,4545 Wang Hall, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA";"Dringenberg, E (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Engn Educ, 2070 Neil Ave,203 Hitchcock, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.";"dringenberg.1@osu.edu; purzer@purdue.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0833366]";"This work was made possible by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under grant no.

This intervention, OEM-Thermo, is designed to prompt the cognitive operations of meaningful learning: organization, elaboration, and monitoring. We also sought evidence to show that execution of these operations was associated with learning gains and that cognitive operations are influenced by different intervention exercises. Purpose/Hypothesis Study 1: Students who complete OEM-Thermo will gain more conceptual knowledge than students who complete traditional problems. Study 2: First, elaboration and monitoring contribute to learning with OEM-Thermo. Second, students engage in elaboration and monitoring at a higher rate when answering elaboration questions than when completing matrix exercises. Design/Method Study 1: A two-group, pre- and post-test experimental design tested OEM-Thermo effectiveness. Study 2: A one-group, pre- and post-test design where participants thought aloud while completing OEM-Thermo tested deep and surface reasoning as well as the frequency of elaboration and monitoring events. Results Study 1: A significant interaction between test time (pre- and post-test) and condition shows that OEM-Thermo promoted development of conceptual reasoning more effectively than did traditional homework problems. Study 2: Significant partial correlations were found between post-test scores on one of two deep reasoning categories and the frequency of elaboration and monitoring events in the think-aloud protocols. Differences were also found in the rate of elaboration across intervention exercises.

However, few studies have systematically explored teaching in this context, leaving a significant gap in our ability to concretely describe faculty practices in ways that support subsequent explorations of the relationships between teaching practices and learning outcomes. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive description of the pedagogical practices used by capstone design faculty from a functional perspective and provide researchers with a framework for subsequent work. Design/Method: This study used qualitative methods to analyze interviews with 42 capstone faculty; the participants represent a stratified purposeful sample of respondents to a national survey. Analysis focused on descriptive coding, beginning with a priori codes, to define broad functions, supplemented with emergent coding to identify concrete practices used in the capstone context. Results: The study resulted in a model of capstone design teaching that includes nine functions (challenge, protect, coach, promote employability, provide exposure, provide role models, accept and confirm, counsel, and build rapport) and 28 associated practices. Conclusions: Capstone faculty use a range of practices designed not only to coach students through the engineering design process but also to more broadly prepare students for workplace practice and build their identity as engineering professionals.";"[Pembridge, James J.] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Engn Fundamentals, Daytona Beach, FL USA; [Paretti, Marie C.] Virginia Tech, Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA";"Paretti, MC (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Engn Educ, 635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.";"james.pembridge@erau.edu; mparetti@vt.edu";NA;"Paretti, Marie/0000-0002-2202-6928";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0846605]";"National Science Foundation Grant/Award Number: 0846605";NA;54;4;4;1;7;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

Concept maps may be effective tools for assessing conceptual knowledge, yet further work is needed to examine scoring methods. PurposeOur purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of three concept map scoring methods. Traditional scoring requires judges to count concept map components. Holistic scoring requires judges to analytically evaluate concept maps using a rubric. Categorical scoring requires judges to categorize concepts according to relevant categories before quantification of overall complexity. Design/MethodIn this study, concept maps were collected from 72 undergraduates before and after a capstone design course. Judges analyzed the concept maps using three methods. Using statistical analyses, we examined the comparability, interrater reliability, and convergent/divergent validity of scoring methods. ResultsWhile traditional scoring allowed judges to score concept maps relatively quickly, holistic scoring allowed judges to better capture changes in knowledge structure, because ranking of data was required without assuming hierarchical concept arrangement. Only categorical scoring provided insight into content and structure of student knowledge. For all methods, interrater reliability was acceptable, and convergent/divergent validity was established. ConclusionsDue to its applicability to concept maps of varying structures, holistic scoring is best if more than one judge is available; traditional scoring is appropriate if there are time constraints or if multiple methods are used. Categorical scoring has potential as a supplemental or stand-alone method, depending on the needs of the instructor or researcher.";"[Watson, Mary Katherine] Miliary Coll South Carolina, The Citadel, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Charleston, SC 29409 USA; [Pelkey, Joshua] AirWatch, Atlanta, GA 30338 USA; [Noyes, Caroline R.] Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Enhancement Teaching & Learning, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Rodgers, Michael O.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA";"Watson, MK (corresponding author), Miliary Coll South Carolina, The Citadel, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 171 Moultrie St, Charleston, SC 29409 USA.";"mwatson9@citadel.edu; joshpelkey@air-watch.com; caroline.noyes@carnegie.gatech.edu; michael.rodgers@ce.gatech.edu";NA;"Watson, Mary Katherine/0000-0003-1718-5825";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0946809]";"Financial support was provided through a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship awarded to M.

Design/MethodThis article is written as a collaborative autoethnography between the first two authors, educators in environmental engineering and art education, respectively. The study is grounded in the educational philosophy of arts advocate Maxine Greene, who views learning as an active, collaborative search for meaning, wide-awakeness, and social change. ResultsOur dialogue reveals the potential for STEAM to provide students and educators with opportunities to explore personally relevant connections between materials, design, society, and the natural environment and to critically engage with implicit and explicit facets of disciplinary identity. ConclusionsThis view of STEAM simultaneously complements and challenges current conceptions of this emerging educational movement that, almost without exception, are underpinned by calls for competitive economic growth and technological development.

Visual cognition studies suggest that features of the visual representations we use to teach students influence what domain knowledge they use to solve problems. However, few studies have explored how visual representations influence what problem-solving strategies and domain knowledge students of different levels of expertise use when solving problems that require them to create and coordinate multiple representations. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study addressed the following research question: How do students with different levels of expertise coordinate their problem-solving strategies, problem-solving heuristics, and representation features when sketching their shear force and bending moment diagrams? Design/Method: We conducted think-aloud interviews while students sketched shear force and bending moment diagrams. These interviews were subsequently analyzed using the constant comparative method to examine the effect of representations on students' problem-solving approaches. Results: Three themes emerged from the data: Students used heuristics that are based on perceptually salient features to sketch their shear force and bending moment diagrams; students across levels of expertise rely on the object translation heuristic rather than equilibrium problem-solving schema to sketch and reason through their shear force and bending moment diagrams, and domain knowledge aids students' ability to resolve conflicting heuristics. Our findings suggest that students primarily rely on heuristics triggered by representation features they notice. Conclusions: Students engaged with shear force and bending moment diagrams not as a way to describe systems that are not accelerating but as a series of representations that should go to zero or arrows that make things not zero.";"[Herman, Geoffrey L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Urbana, IL USA";"Johnson-Glauch, N (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Mat Engn, 1 Grand Ave San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.";"njohns66@calpoly.edu; glherman@illinois.edu";NA;"Johnson-Glauch, Nicole/0000-0001-8305-4618";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1429348]";"National Science Foundation Grant/Award Number: 1429348";NA;95;3;3;3;12;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

In fact, many undergraduate courses focus on developing students' knowledge and understanding of core engineering concepts. At the same time, a growing body of literature points to substantial gaps across educational and professional practice contexts, including how problems are embodied and solved. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore potential differences in conceptual understanding across engineering students and professional engineers. To do so, we compared the responses of civil engineering practitioners to the Statics Concept Inventory (SCI) to those of engineering students enrolled in statics courses. Design/Method: We administered the SCI to 95 practicing civil engineers and compared their responses to an existing dataset from 1,372 engineering students. We conducted three comparisons: overall SCI score, concept subscores, and item-by-item. Results: Students generally outperformed engineers on the SCI in terms of overall performance. However, on closer inspection, students' superior performance appears to be driven by differences in knowledge or understanding of specific statics concepts rather than a stronger understanding in general. Conclusions: We caution against interpretations that imply students have a better understanding of statics concepts. Instead, our results suggest that differences in the way concepts are situated and applied across school and workplace contexts might account for the differences in the performance observed. These findings raise critical questions regarding the nature of concepts and the immutability of common academic representations, and point to the need for further qualitative and exploratory work investigating concepts in practice.";"[Brown, Shane; Perova-Mello, Natasha] Oregon State Univ, Civil Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lutz, Ben] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Mech Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Ha, Oai] Western Carolina Univ, Mech Engn, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA";"Brown, S (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.";"shane.brown@oregonstate.edu; blutz@calpoly.edu; perovamn@oregonstate.edu; otha@wcu.edu";NA;NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1055356]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1055356";NA;84;2;2;0;0;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

However, intentional mixing throughout the research design-particularly during data analysis-may enable richer meta-inferences about a phenomenon. Purpose: This paper provides examples of strategies for mixing during data analysis in mixed methods program evaluation in engineering education. Although the context is program evaluation, the procedures are applicable in engineering education research more broadly. Scope/Method: This review presents examples of mixed methods analysis strategies in the context of a data set with qualitative and quantitative data from a global engineering program at a large Mid-Atlantic university. The structure of the examples presents mixed research questions, pragmatic purposes for such studies, and examples of different mixing strategies for the analysis stage. The mixing strategies highlighted include extreme case sampling, converting, creating a blended variable, blending variables and themes across strands, and cross-case comparison. Conclusions: This review of mixed methods in program evaluation prompted a reflection of processes in the design of studies, how the designs are described beyond the usual taxonomies in the mixed methods literature, and implications for the greater community of engineering education researchers.

Women choose engineering at lower rates than men. This article uses critical engineering agency (CEA) to understand first-year students' attitudes and self-beliefs to predict the choice of an engineering career. Purpose/Hypothesis We investigated how first-year students' math and physics identities and students' beliefs about the ability of science to improve the world predict choice of engineering as a career and whether these beliefs differ by gender. Design/Method The data were from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering survey distributed during fall 2011 (N = 6,772). Structural equation modeling was used to understand first-year students' affective beliefs for predicting engineering career choice. Results Math and physics identities are important for predicting engineering choice at the beginning of college. Recognition from others and interest in a subject are positive predictors of physics and math identities. Students' performance/competence beliefs alone are negative predictors of engineering career choice but are mediated by interest and recognition from others. Student identities and agency beliefs are significant predictors of engineering career choice, explaining 20% of the variance. We also found gender differences in students' math and physics identities and agency beliefs. Conclusions This article emphasizes the importance of students' recognition beliefs and the importance of agency beliefs for women in predicting engineering career choice.";"[Godwin, Allison] Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47097 USA; [Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra] Florida Int Univ, Dept Phys, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Potvin, Geoff] Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Hazari, Zahra] Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Dept Teaching & Learning, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Lock, Robynne] Texas A&M Univ, Phys, POB 3011, Commerce, TX 75429 USA";"Godwin, A (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Engn Educ, Neil Armstrong Hall Engn,701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47097 USA.; Potvin, G; Hazari, Z (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Phys, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.; Potvin, G (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.; Hazari, Z (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Dept Teaching & Learning, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.; Lock, R (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Phys, POB 3011, Commerce, TX 75429 USA.";"godwina@purdue.edu; gpotvin@fiu.edu; zhazari@fiu.edu; Robynne.Lock@tamuc.edu";"Hazari, Zahra/AAR-5373-2020";"Godwin, Allison/0000-0002-0741-3356";"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1036617]; Graduate Research Fellowship";"This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation through grant 1036617 and a Graduate Research Fellowship.

Design/Method This study employed genre analysis methods to investigate the argumentation patterns of a corpus of 50 winning engineering NSF GRFP research proposals, using a rhetorical move-step coding framework modified from prior genre work in English research. Results The genre analysis resulted in nine rhetorical moves and subcategorical steps. The argumentation codes were graphed as a function of progress through the document to create maps of argumentation that can be compared across the corpus. Four resulting categories of genre maps emerged from the findings, indicating major patterns in argumentation structure.

Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of the current study was to examine changes in implicit beliefs about intelligence and effort beliefs across the first semester of undergraduate engineering education, to investigate how these beliefs may contribute to first-semester achievement, and to explore changes in students' perceptions of the relative contributions of effort and ability/intelligence to grades. Design/Method Data from first-time, full-time engineering undergraduates at a large Midwestern university were collected at Weeks 1 and 13 of the first semester. Analyses were replicated across two cohorts (2013 and 2014). Results On average, students entered and ended the semester with relatively incremental and positive effort beliefs. Surprisingly, incremental beliefs did not predict grade point average (GPA). Positive effort beliefs were associated with GPA in both cohorts. Findings regarding the role that perceived effort plays in achievement were replicated across cohorts. The average trajectory was as follows: atWeek 1, students perceived that ability/intelligence was the primary contributor to high school achievement but anticipated that effort would play a greater role in undergraduate coursework; atWeek 13, students on average reflected that the role of effort was less than originally anticipated. Conclusion Although implicit beliefs about intelligence and effort beliefs remained fairly stable across the first semester, students in both cohorts exhibited similar shifts in perceptions of the importance of effort (relative to ability/intelligence) for academic success.";"[Snyder, Kate E.] Univ Louisville, Educ Psychol Measurement & Evaluat, ECPY Dept, Room 320,Coll Educ & Human Dev Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Barr, Sebastian M.; Pittard, Caroline M.] Univ Louisville, Counseling Psychol, ECPY Dept, Room 320,Coll Educ & Human Dev Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Ralston, Patricia A.

Purpose This study sought to compare word-level, sentence-level, and organizational differences in writing by practitioners and students and to identify differences that are important for engineering practice. I also sought to demonstrate the untapped potential for linguistic analyses to contribute to understanding engineering writing. Design/Method I used techniques from applied linguistics - corpus linguistics and rhetorical move analysis - supplemented with interviews of practitioners and students. The analysis investigated the interaction of language features, their functions, and writers' motivations. Results Student writing had more complicated sentence structures, less accurate word choice, more errors in grammar and punctuation, and less linear organization. These characteristics decreased effectiveness in areas that practitioners considered important: accurate and unambiguous content; fast, predicable reading; liability management; and attention to detail. Underlying the student writing problems were misconceptions about effective writing, ignorance of genre expectations, weak language skills, and a failure to appreciate that written words, not just calculations, express engineering content.

Yet practices for promoting its development in engineering students both within and outside of ethics education remain largely underexplored. PurposeThe objective of this investigation was twofold: first, we explored the aspects of an engineering ethics course that contributed to changes in perspective-taking among graduate-level engineering students. Second, we explored the nature of these changes. Design/MethodWe used Critical Incident Technique to explore these two research objectives. To enhance the rigor of this qualitative investigation, we implemented Walther, Sochacka, and Kellam's Quality Framework. ResultsThe analysis of 24 critical incidents extracted from post-course interviews resulted in five distinct but related themes representing potential causes of changes in perspective-taking. Themes included the sharing of diverse perspectives, the challenge of ethical decision-making, projection exercises, repetitive application of Reflexive Principlism, and experiencing cognitive dissonance. Second, we found four themes representing the nature of perspectivetaking changes, including open-mindedness, holistic perspective-taking, principle-based perspective-taking, and worldview broadening. ConclusionsThese findings elucidate nuances engineering educators might consider when seeking perspective-taking development among their students, such as the nature of case study prompts and the relationship between perspective-taking and ethical reasoning processes.";"[Hess, Justin L.] IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Strobel, Johannes] Univ Missouri, Sch Informat Sci & Learning Technol, 221B Townsend Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Strobel, Johannes] Univ Missouri, Coll Educ, Makerspace, 221B Townsend Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Brightman, Andrew O.] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, Engn Practice, 206 S Martin C Jischke Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Hess, JL (corresponding author), IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.";"hessjl@iupui.edu; strobelj@missouri.edu; aob@purdue.edu";"Hess, Justin/AAB-9371-2019";NA;"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-133468]; Ethics Education in Science and Engineering program [1237868]";"This work was made possible by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under grant number DGE-133468 and the Ethics Education in Science and Engineering program under grant number 1237868.

Purpose/Hypothesis According to cognitive load theory, humans have limited working memory but relatively unlimited long-term memory. Thus, we hypothesized that testing conditions with a high level of automaticity would yield better execution outcomes than those with a low level of automaticity (Hypothesis 1). We hypothesized that testing conditions with low demand on WML would be superior to those with a high demand on WML on the measures of execution outcomes (i.e., accuracy and response time; Hypothesis 2). We expected to observe the interaction between automaticity and WML by alternating the difficulty levels of the task characteristics and involving working memory through the primary task (Hypothesis 3). Design/Method We utilized a 2 (two levels of WML: four steps versus five steps) x 2 (two levels of automaticity: automatized schemas enforced or not enforced) design. The participants were 31 college engineering students enrolled in a fundamental structural analysis course at a university in the northeastern United States. Results Findings indicate that automaticity can explain a large percentage of the variance in participants' scores and response times; that is, despite the levels of WML, participants scored higher and performed faster under high automaticity conditions than under low automaticity conditions. WML explained a large between-subject variance in response time, but it accounted for a nonsignificant percentage of the score variance. The interaction effect between automaticity and WML on response time was statistically significant, but the interaction effect on score was not significant. Conclusion Our findings are aligned with cognitive load theory and the idea that humans have limited WML. In addition, our results underscore the importance of automaticity in problem solving, especially when the task demands high WML. It appears that automaticity helps engineering learners bypass the limits of human working memory. The implications of our findings for engineering educators are also discussed.";"[Wang, Qian] Manhattan Coll, Civil & Environm Engn, 4513 Manhattan Coll Pkwy, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA; [Ding, Yi] Fordham Univ, Sch Psychol, 113 West 60th St,Lowenstein Bldg Room 1008, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Yu, Qiong] Fordham Univ, Sch Psychol Program, 113 West 60th St,Lowenstein Bldg, New York, NY 10023 USA";"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Manhattan Coll, Civil & Environm Engn, 4513 Manhattan Coll Pkwy, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA.";"qian.wang@manhattan.edu; yding4@fordham.edu; qyu28@fordham.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;63;0;0;1;13;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

Despite the documented influence of motivation on learning, little research exists that examines how motivation and problem solving in engineering interconnect. Purpose This study explores how engineering students perceive problem solving tasks, the future, and the connections between the two. Methods Interviews with engineering students (n59) about engineering problems, problem solving processes, their futures, and interactions between their futures and problem solving tasks were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Analysis of the resulting transcripts identified and clustered units of meaning into themes, first by participant and then across participants. Results Three themes emerged from the IPA: participants perceived engineering as being primarily a problem solving process; participants reported using different problem solving processes depending on how well the task aligned with their future goals; and participants' perceptions of their future drove the problem solving processes they report using. Conclusions This work supports and extends engineering problem solving literature by making explicit the connections students describe between their problem solving processes and their future-oriented motivations. Additionally, this work furthers our understanding of how future-oriented motivations are conceptualized by engineering students.";"[Kirn, Adam] Univ Nevada, Engn Educ, 1664 N Virginia, Reno, NV 89503 USA; [Benson, Lisa] Clemson Univ, Engn & Sci Educ, Holtzendorff Hall, Clemson, SC 29643 USA";"Kirn, A (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Engn Educ, 1664 N Virginia, Reno, NV 89503 USA.";"akirn@unr.edu; lbenson@clemson.edu";NA;"Kirn, Adam/0000-0001-6344-5072";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EEC-1055950]";"This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (EEC-1055950).

Social cognitive career theory (SCCT) states that career interest is influenced by four cognitive-person variables: self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, interests, and goals. Other variables, such as social supports and barriers, also play an important role. Purpose This study explores the influence of gender and STEM major on perceived supports and barriers. It also analyzes the effects of perceived supports and barriers on the SCCT cognitive-person variables. Method Participants were 811 sophomore students in STEM programs at the University of Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests analyzed the difference in the perceived supports and barriers by gender and students' major. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was implemented to predict the relationship between perceived supports and barriers and SCCT cognitive-person variables. Results The engineering students perceived more teaching staff barriers and fewer teaching staff supports than other students. Male software and hardware engineering students perceived more barriers than other male engineering students. The fit of the model revealed an important effect of perceived teaching staff supports on the four cognitive-person variables. Conclusions To determine the influences on the cognitive-person variables, it is necessary to analyze the perceived supports and barriers. Peers and family are the most important perceived supports, while teaching staff and financial difficulties are the greatest perceived barriers.";"[Pena-Calvo, Jose-Vicente] Univ Oviedo, Sociol Educ, Asturias, Spain; [Pena-Calvo, Jose-Vicente; Inda-Caro, Mercedes; Rodriguez-Menendez, Carmen; Fernandez-Garcia, Carmen-Maria] Fac Formac Profesorado & Educ, C Aniceto Sela Sn, Oviedo 33005, Spain; [Inda-Caro, Mercedes] Univ Oviedo, Theory Educ, Asturias, Spain; [Rodriguez-Menendez, Carmen] Univ Oviedo, Anthropol Educ, Asturias, Spain; [Fernandez-Garcia, Carmen-Maria] Univ Oviedo, Comparat Educ, Asturias, Spain";"Pena-Calvo, JV (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Sociol Educ, Asturias, Spain.; Pena-Calvo, JV; Inda-Caro, M; Rodriguez-Menendez, C; Fernandez-Garcia, CM (corresponding author), Fac Formac Profesorado & Educ, C Aniceto Sela Sn, Oviedo 33005, Spain.; Inda-Caro, M (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Theory Educ, Asturias, Spain.; Rodriguez-Menendez, C (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Anthropol Educ, Asturias, Spain.; Fernandez-Garcia, CM (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Comparat Educ, Asturias, Spain.";"vipe@uniovi.es; indamaria@uniovi.es; carmenrm@uniovi.es; fernandezcarmen@uniovi.es";"Rodriguez, carmen/K-8863-2014; Garcia, Carmen- Maria Fernandez -/AAK-4092-2020; Inda-Caro, Mercedes/K-9818-2014; Fernandez Garcia, Carmen Maria/K-9863-2014";"Garcia, Carmen- Maria Fernandez -/0000-0001-6314-355X; Inda-Caro, Mercedes/0000-0003-4752-3258; Fernandez Garcia, Carmen Maria/0000-0001-6314-355X; Rodriguez Menendez, Carmen/0000-0001-7074-8223; Pena Calvo, Jose Vicente/0000-0003-0200-9116";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness";"This article is based on work supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

Much existing engineering education research uses individual-level (such as psychological) theories to explain this difference. The study reported here instead takes a structural perspective, asking how social relations are coordinated in engineering education. Purpose: This study explores how the intersection of ruling relations, critical race, and feminist theories can investigate how gender and race are built into engineering education's institutional structure. Design/Method: This study used interviews collected from 17 women and men of color and White women who were engineering undergraduate students at U.S. universities. The interviews were drawn from a project that takes as its premise that learning from such small numbers of students facilitates analyzing data intersectionally. The primary analysis used narrative methods through repeated readings. Results: I offer empirically based illustrations of ruling relations in U.S. universities and schools of engineering that unduly impact minoritized populations. These illustrations include discussions of financial aid knowledge, meeting the needs of transfer and Native students, and how schools crafting the ideal student as a young, single White male problematically impact minoritized students. The results illustrate how ruling relations structure engineering education in White- and male-dominated ways. Conclusions: This paper offers questions to help readers consider how ruling relations race and gender their own institutions. In addition, it offers an interpretive, emergent method for interrogating institutional structure and ideas for future work using ruling relations in engineering education research.";"[Pawley, Alice L.] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA";"Pawley, AL (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, 701 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.";"apawley@purdue.edu";"Pawley, Alice/A-2801-2011";"Pawley, Alice/0000-0001-9117-4855";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1055900]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1055900";NA;75;5;5;0;5;"AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"WASHINGTON";"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA";"1069-4730";"2168-9830";NA;"J ENG EDUC";"J.

The development of these skills is often done only through ad hoc approaches, without a well-structured curriculum design framework. Disagreement over the nuances and interpretations of generic skills across disciplines makes framework design even more challenging. Purpose/Hypothesis To investigate students' perceptions of generic skills on a disciplinary basis, this article reports the development and validation of the Generic Skills Perception Questionnaire designed for investigating engineering students' perceptions of their level of competency in these skills. Design/Method The questionnaire was administered to 1,241 first-year engineering students from three universities in Hong Kong. Most of the questionnaire was items asking students to rate their perceived level of competency in 38 generic skills. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to examine the psychometric properties of the instrument for providing evidence on reliability and validity. Results Exploratory factor analysis resulted in eight scales. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the correlated eight-factor model and higher-order factor model provided an acceptable fit with the data. Cronbach's alpha values indicated that the scales were reliable. Conclusions The questionnaire was reliable and valid.

However, the engineering design discourse in K-12 science classrooms has not yet been fully examined. PurposeThis article aims to explore the decision-making processes and verbal interactions of eighth grade students as they engage in a 12-day engineering design-based science unit. The following research questions guided the study: (a) How do student discourse patterns and interactions affect design decisions? (b) How do the instructor's discursive interactions in design groups influence student design? MethodIn this exploratory case study, discursive patterns and interaction patterns between four student groups and their instructor were captured through audio and video recordings. ResultsThe design discourse structure and patterns differed among groups, affecting their design decisions. There was also a difference in both the number of new ideas generated and, most notably, the level of student engagement in those groups. In addition, the complexity of design decisions varied, with most groups focusing on financial feasibility rather than scientific reasoning. Finally, it was observed that the instructor discourse influenced student engagement in design discourse and the use of scientific reasoning and justifications in small group discussions. ConclusionsThis discourse study offers insight into students' scientific reasoning in an effort to help educators more effectively structure instruction discourse and practices in engineering design in K-12 science education.";"[Guzey, S.

Analysis of the resulting dataset poses unique challenges; methods in the status quo are tailored for specific spectrum-related applications (apps), and are ill equipped to process data of this magnitude. In this paper, we design BigSpec, a general-purpose framework that allows for fast processing of apps. The key idea is to reduce computation costs by performing computation extensively on compressed data that preserves signal features. Adhering to this guideline, we build solutions for three apps, i.e., energy detection, spatio-temporal spectrum estimation, and anomaly detection. These apps were chosen to highlight BigSpec's efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. To evaluate BigSpec's performance, we collect more than 1 terabyte of spectrum data spanning a year, across 300MHz-4GHz, covering 400 km(2). Compared with baselines and prior works, we achieve 17x run time efficiency, sublinear rather than linear run time scalability, and extend the definition of anomaly to different domains (frequency & spatio-temporal).

Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where RF filters channelize the SI signal path. Unlike other FD implementations, that mostly rely on delay lines, FDE-based cancellers can be realized in small-form-factor devices. However, the fundamental limits and higher layer challenges associated with these cancellers were not explored yet. Therefore, and in order to support the integration with a software-defined radio (SDR) and to facilitate experimentation in a testbed with several nodes, we design and implement an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We derive and experimentally validate the PCB canceller model and present a canceller configuration scheme based on an optimization problem. We then extensively evaluate the performance of the FDE-based FD radio in the SDR testbed. Experiments show that it achieves 95 dB overall SIC (52 dB from RF SIC) across 20 MHz bandwidth, and an average link-level FD gain of 1.87.. We also conduct experiments in: (i) uplink-downlink networks with inter-user interference, and (ii) heterogeneous networks with half-duplex and FD users. The experimental FD gains in the two types of networks confirm previous analytical results. They depend on the users' SNR values and the number of FD users, and are 1.14.-1.25. and 1.25.-1.73., respectively. Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare the RFIC and PCB implementations and study various design tradeoffs.";"[Chen, Tingjun; Dastjerdi, Mahmood Baraani; Krishnaswamy, Harish; Zussman, Gil] Columbia Univ, Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhou, Jin] Univ Illinois, Elect & Comp Engn, Champaign, IL USA";"Chen, TJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.";"tingjun@ee.columbia.edu; b.mahmood@ee.columbia.edu; jinzhou@illinois.edu; harish@ee.columbia.edu; gil@ee.columbia.edu";NA;NA;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ECCS-1547406, CNS-1650685, CNS-1827923]";"This work was supported in part by NSF grants ECCS-1547406, CNS-1650685, and CNS-1827923.

The IoT vision for ubiquitous interconnection, in practice, demands multi-hop connectivity for robust and scalable sensor networks, as well as compatibility with such prevailing wireless technologies as WiFi. Today's backscatter solutions however typically follow a single-hop paradigm, i.e., tags do not relay for each other. This paper presents X-Tandem, a multi-hop backscatter system that works with commodity WiFi devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that sensing tags can not only work as relays for each other but also modulate their sensing data into a single backscatter packet, which remains a legit WiFi packet that can be decoded with any commercial WiFi NICs. We discuss the design details of X-Tandem and have built a prototype with FPGAs and off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The prototype demonstrates a two-hop implementation, achieving a throughput up to 200 bps with tag-to-tag distances up to 0.4 m and communication ranges up to 8 m.

The design of TouchAuth is based on the electrostatics of iBEP generation and a resulting property, i.e., the iBEPs at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy. Our experiments also show that a range of possible interfering sources including appliances' electromagnetic emanations and noise injections into the power network do not affect the performance of TouchAuth. A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.";"[Yan, Zhenyu; Song, Qun; Tan, Rui; Kong, Adams Wai Kin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Yang] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang] Illinois Singapore, Adv Digital Sci Ctr, Singapore, Singapore";"Yan, ZY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore.";"zyan006@ntu.edu.sg; song0167@ntu.edu.sg; tanrui@ntu.edu.sg; yli@szu.edu.cn; adamskong@ntu.edu.sg";"Yan, Zhenyu/U-2106-2019";"Yan, Zhenyu/0000-0002-4433-5211";"Nanyang Technological UniversityNanyang Technological University";"The authors wish to thank our shepherd Dr. Alanson Sample and the anonymous reviewers for providing valuable feedback on this work.

How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting very simple authentication operations, e.g., clicking buttons, twisting rotary knobs, and swiping touchscreens. Unlike the state-of-theart methods, our method does not require any hardware modifications of devices, and thus can be applied to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices.

The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality - existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC thatfi lls in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver.

To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (e.g., 2.4GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. Our work, which is called TiFi, challenges this belief by allowing a 2.4GHz WiFi receiver (e.g., a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840 920MI Iz. TIE does not require changing current smartphones or tags. Instead, it leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with Will receivers. We design and implement Till with commodity WiFi chipsets (e.g., Broadcom BCM43xx, Murata KM6D280 40, and Qualcomm WCN3990).

To improve users' experiences, caching at the wireless access points (APs) has been proposed for bringing the contents closer to users. However, the wireless content placement is challenging as the placement is affected by many realistic constraints, such as a large number of APs, interaction among neighboring APs, various local content popularities. In this paper, we study the wireless caching problem, i.e., which contents should be stored by which APs. First, we fulfil these constraints to formulate our problem and introduce an objective function that maximizes the total cache hit rate of all APs. Next, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose a local distributed caching algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we provide a game theoretic perspective on the problem and prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the Nash Equilibrium in polynomial time.

However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate.

Users with high data needs suffer in such locations due to insufficient network bandwidth. A similar insufficiency can also be felt by flash crowds in locations with otherwise moderate signal strength due to division of the available bandwidth. We explore the possibility of using drones as a solution to this problem. The drones can hover with direct line of sight with a cellphone tower and extend cellular coverage into the weaker regions. Our idea is to use the knowledge of large structures in the area to compute the expected SNR space around the client's current location.

The ever-increasing cyber components of vehicles (i.e., computation, communication, and control), however, incur new risks of anomalies, as demonstrated by the millions of vehicles recalled by different manufactures. To mitigate these risks, we design B-Diag, a battery-based diagnostics system that guards vehicles against anomalies with a cyber-physical approach, and implement B-Diag as an add-on module of commodity vehicles attached to automotive batteries, thus providing vehicles an additional layer of protection. B-Diag is inspired by the fact that the automotive battery operates in strong dependency with many physical components of the vehicle, which is observable as correlations between battery voltage and the vehicle's corresponding operational parameters, e.g., a faster revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the engine, in general, leads to a higher battery voltage. B-Diag exploits such physically-induced correlations to diagnose vehicles by cross-validating the vehicle information with battery voltage, based on a set of data-driven norm models constructed online. Such a design of B-Diag is steered by a dataset collected with a prototype system when driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in real-life over 3 months, covering a total mileage of about 1, 400 miles. Besides the Crosstrek, we have also evaluated B-Diag with driving traces of a 2008 Honda Fit, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and a 2017 Volkswagen Passat, showing B-Diag detects vehicle anomalies with >86% (up to 99%) averaged detection rate.";"[He, Liang] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Kong, Linghe; Liu, Ziyang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shu, Yuanchao] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA; [Liu, Cong] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA";"He, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA.";NA;NA;NA;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1739577]";"We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the shepherd, Dr. Marco Gruteser, for constructive suggestions.

However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures. We consider using multiple GPS receivers on the drone as a failsafe mechanism for IMU failures. The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2 degrees even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile.";"[Gowda, Mahanth; Dhekne, Ashutosh; Choudhury, Romit Roy] Univ Illinois UIUC, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Manweiler, Justin; Weisz, Justin D.] IBM Res, Yorktown Hts, NY USA";"Gowda, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois UIUC, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.";"gowda2@illinois.edu; jmanweiler@us.ibm.com; dhekne2@illinois.edu; croy@illinois.edu; jweisz@us.ibm.com";NA;NA;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS - 1423455]";"We sincerely thank the reviewers and the anonymous shepherd for their valuable feedback.

We find that network latency varies significantly and unpredictably at short time scales and that high tail latency substantially degrades user experience. We also find an increase in coverage options available due to commercial WiFi offerings and that variations in latency across network options are not well-correlated. Based on these findings, we develop RAVEN, an in-kernel MPTCP scheduler that mitigates tail latency and network unpredictability by using redundant transmission when confidence about network latency predictions is low. RAVEN has several novel design features. It operates transparently, without application modification or hints, to improve interactive latency. It seamlessly supports three or more wireless networks. Its in-kernel implementation allows proactive cancellation of transmissions made unnecessary through redundancy. Finally, it explicitly considers how the age of measurements affects confidence in predictions, allowing better handling of interactive applications that transmit infrequently and networks that exhibit periods of temporary poor performance.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual cluster (VC) placement in MMCs, to minimize the average response latency with various requests among multiple cloud applications. Then a hybrid swarm intelligence approach is proposed to optimize VC placement scheme, for a trade-off between the average response latency and the over-all VC placement cost. The preliminary evaluation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.";"[Liu, Xuan; Cheng, Bo; Wang, Meng; Chen, Junling] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Liu, X (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing, Peoples R China.";"liuxuan0527@bupt.edu.cn; chengbo@bupt.edu.cn; mengwang@bupt.edu.cn; chjl@bupt.edu.cn";NA;NA;"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB14006 03]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61772479]";"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFB14006 03),Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61772479).";NA;7;0;0;0;0;"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY";"NEW YORK";"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA";NA;NA;"978-1-4503-6169-9";NA;NA;NA;2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"10.1145/3300061.3343388";NA;NA;3;"Telecommunications";"Telecommunications";"BO6KM";"WOS:000521112500063";NA;NA;NA;NA;"2020-09-24";NA;"MOBICOM"

However, today's evolved packet core (EPC) that orchestrates the LTE RAN faces fundamental limitations in catering to such a challenging, wireless and mobile UAV environment, particularly in the presence of multiple BSs (UAVs). In this work, we argue for and propose an alternate, radical edge EPC design, called SkyCore that pushes the EPC functionality to the extreme edge of the core network - collapses the EPC into a single, light-weight, self-contained entity that is co-located with each of the UAV BS. SkyCore incorporates elements that are designed to address the unique challenges facing such a distributed design in the UAV environment, namely the resource-constraints of UAV platforms, and the distributed management of pronounced UAV and UE mobility. We build and deploy a fully functional version of SkyCore on a two-UAV LTE network and showcase its (i) ability to interoperate with commercial LTE BSs as well as smartphones, (ii) support for both hotspot and standalone multi-UAV deployments, and (iii) superior control and data plane performance compared to other EPC variants in this environment.";"[Moradi, Mehrdad; Mao, Z.

Achieving high tracking accuracy is essential to provide enjoyable user experience. To this end, we develop a novel system that uses audio signals to achieve mm-level tracking accuracy. It lets multiple speakers transmit inaudible sounds at different frequencies. Based on the received sound, our system continuously estimates the distance and velocity of the mobile with respect to the speakers to continuously track it. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the absolute distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to enhance the accuracy, and efficiently solve the optimization problem.

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning.

However, the complex dependencies between computing and radio resources make vRAN resource control particularly daunting. We present vrAIn, a dynamic resource controller for vRANs based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we use an autoencoder to project high-dimensional context data (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, we use a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network structure and a classifier to map (encoded) contexts into resource control decisions. We have implemented vrAIn using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control actions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over CPU-unaware methods; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over static allocation policies using similar CPU resources in average; (iii) upon CPU capacity shortage, it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art schemes; and (iv) it performs close to optimal policies resulting from an offline oracle.

We provide the first systematic study of Android DA capabilities, DDA apps, DDA-attack resistance across Android versions, and DDA-induced families in malicious apps.

Such capabilities can be enabled with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but it remains difficult to execute large networks on mobile devices. Offloading object detection to the edge or cloud is also very challenging due to the stringent requirements on high detection accuracy and low end-to-end latency. The long latency of existing offloading techniques can significantly reduce the detection accuracy due to changes in the user's view. To address the problem, we design a system that enables high accuracy object detection for commodity AR/MR system running at 60fps. The system employs low latency offloading techniques, decouples the rendering pipeline from the offloading pipeline, and uses a fast object tracking method to maintain detection accuracy. The result shows that the system can improve the detection accuracy by 20.2%-34.8% for the object detection and human keypoint detection tasks, and only requires 2.24ms latency for object tracking on the AR device. Thus, the system leaves more time and computational resources to render virtual elements for the next frame and enables higher quality AR/MR experiences.";"[Liu, Luyang; Li, Hongyu; Gruteser, Marco] Rutgers State Univ, WINLAB, North Brunswick, NJ 08902 USA";"Liu, LY (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, WINLAB, North Brunswick, NJ 08902 USA.";"luyang@winlab.rutgers.edu; hongyuli@winlab.rutgers.edu; gruteser@winlab.rutgers.edu";"Liu, Luyang/AAT-4248-2020";NA;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1329939, 1827923]";"We sincerely thank our shepherd Karthik Dantu and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

To support these apps, hardware requirements of these devices are increasing rapidly. Mobile SoCs need a larger number of faster cores, better GPUs and above all, higher DRAM capacities to do justice to user experience. To augment capacity requirements, non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been proposed as a potential addition to LPDDR variants, which have been the mainstay of mobile SoCs. However, few tools exist to carry out architectural design space exploration of main memory hierarchies featuring NVMs for newer Android and app versions. In this paper, we present META, a trace based tool for facilitating the exploration of memory hierarchies in mobile devices. META uses an enhanced version of Android emulator for generating raw instruction traces.

Current gold-standard BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively.

To address these drawbacks, we utilize Electric Toll Collection systems (ETC) as a large-scale sensor network and design a system called VeMo to transparently model and predict vehicle mobility at the individual level with a full penetration rate. Our novelty is how we address uncertainty issues (i. e., unknown routes and speeds) due to sparse implicit ETC data based on a key data-driven insight, i. e., individual driving behaviors are strongly correlated with crowds of drivers under certain spatiotemporal contexts and can be predicted by combining both personal habits and context information. More importantly, we evaluate VeMo with (i) a large-scale ETC system with tracking devices at 773 highway entrances and exits capturing more than 2 million vehicles every day; (ii) a fleet consisting of 114 thousand vehicles with GPS data as ground truth.

Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques. We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP - SiNgle Antenna Proximity that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device.

Malicious external attackers or untrustworthy internal administrators of clouds may leak highly sensitive and private data such as image, voice and textual data. In this paper, we propose OCCLUMENCY, a novel cloud-driven solution designed to protect user privacy without compromising the benefit of using powerful cloud resources. OCCLUMENCY leverages secure SGX enclave to preserve the confidentiality and the integrity of user data throughout the entire DL inference process. DL inference in SGX enclave, however, impose a severe performance degradation due to limited physical memory space and inefficient page swapping. We designed a suite of novel techniques to accelerate DL inference inside the enclave with a limited memory size and implemented Occlumency based on Caffe. Our experiment with various DNN models shows that Occlumency improves inference speed by 3.6x compared to the baseline DL inference in SGX and achieves a secure DL inference within 72% of latency overhead compared to inference in the native environment.";"[Lee, Taegyeong; Pushp, Saumay; Song, Junehwa] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lin, Zhiqi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Li, Caihua] Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA; [Lee, Taegyeong; Lin, Zhiqi; Li, Caihua; Liu, Yunxin; Xu, Fengyuan; Xu, Chenren; Zhang, Lintao] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA; [Lee, Youngki] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Xu, Fengyuan] Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chenren] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Lee, T (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.";"tglee@nclab.kaist.ac.kr; ralzq01@mail.ustc.edu.cn; saumay@nclab.kaist.ac.kr; caihua.li@rice.edu; yunxin.liu@microsoft.com; youngkilee@snu.ac.kr; fengyuan.xu@nju.edu.cn; chenren@pku.edu.cn; lintaoz@microsoft.com; junesong@nclab.kaist.ac.kr";NA;NA;"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2017R1A2B3010504, 2017M3C4A7065963, 2019R1C1C1006088]; MSRA Collaborative Research 2018 Grant Award;  [NSFC-61872180];  [NSFC-61802007]";"We thank our shepherd Nicholas D.

We find that about 75% of 802.11n and 50% of 802.11ac client devices operate at 75% of their maximum or more and that the bitrates of the remaining devices can be very far from their maximum. These low bitrates could significantly reduce the throughput of high-bitrate devices.";"[Gao, Yixuan; Abedi, Ali; Brecht, Tim] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Bhagavatula, Ramya] Google Inc, Mountain View, CA USA";"Gao, YX (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.";"yixuan.gao@edu.uwaterloo.ca; ali.abedi@uwaterloo.ca; brecht@cs.uwaterloo.ca; rbhagavatula@google.com";NA;NA;"NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Google; URI program at the University of Waterloo";"We thank NSERC and Google for financial support.

In this study, we address this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQR code), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moire pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQR codes is > 98%. The decryption rate for cameras positioned 20 degrees off axis or > 10cm from the designated location drops to 0%, indicating that any attackers will be unable to steal a usable image.";"[Pan, Hao; Yang, Lanqing; Chen, Yi-Chao; Xue, Guangtao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [You, Chuang-Wen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ji, Xiaoyu] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Pai-Yen] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA";"Pan, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.";"panh09@sjtu.edu.cn; yanglanqing@sjtu.edu.cn; yichao@utexas.edu; xue-gt@cs.sjtu.edu.cn; cwyou2004@gmail.com; xji@zju.edu.cn; pychen@uic.edu";"Chen, Pai-Yen/AAR-3291-2020";"Chen, Pai-Yen/0000-0002-8112-8457";NA;NA;NA;5;0;0;0;0;"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY";"NEW YORK";"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA";NA;NA;"978-1-4503-6169-9";NA;NA;NA;2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"10.1145/3300061.3343391";NA;NA;3;"Telecommunications";"Telecommunications";"BO6KM";"WOS:000521112500065";NA;NA;NA;NA;"2020-09-24";NA;"MOBICOM"

SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.";"[Lee, Royson; Venieris, Stylianos I.; Dudziak, Lukasz; Bhattacharya, Sourav; Lane, Nicholas D.] Samsung AI Ctr, Cambridge, England; [Lane, Nicholas D.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England";"Lee, R (corresponding author), Samsung AI Ctr, Cambridge, England.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;62;0;0;0;0;"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY";"NEW YORK";"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA";NA;NA;"978-1-4503-6169-9";NA;NA;NA;2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"10.1145/3300061.3345455";NA;NA;16;"Telecommunications";"Telecommunications";"BO6KM";"WOS:000521112500029";NA;NA;NA;NA;"2020-09-24";NA;"MOBICOM"

Li-Fi, also known as light fidelity, is a full duplex communication network enabling transmittal of data. The potency of bidirectional Visible Light Communication allows us to build an ideal medium, independent of congested radio frequencies and interference from electromagnetic waves, thus, resulting in faster data transfer. It has been proven in various research studies that more than 90% of the data consumption happens indoors.

Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.";"[Jiang, Wenjun; Miao, Chenglin; Ma, Fenglong; Wang, Yaqing; Xue, Hongfei; Song, Chen; Ma, Xin; Koutsonikolas, Dimitrios; Xu, Wenyao; Su, Lu] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Yao, Shuochao] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Yuan, Ye] Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Su, L (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.";"wenjunji@buffalo.edu; cmiao@buffalo.edu; fenglong@buffalo.edu; syao9@illinois.edu; yaqingwa@buffalo.edu; yuanye91@emails.bjut.edu.cn; hongfeix@buffalo.edu; csong5@buffalo.edu; xma24@buffalo.edu; dimitrio@buffalo.edu; wenyaoxu@buffalo.edu; lusu@buffalo.edu";NA;"Ma, Xin/0000-0003-4523-4233; Ma, Fenglong/0000-0002-4999-0303";"US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1652503, CNS-1629929]";"We thank our anonymous shepherd and reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on this paper.

EQ-Radio transmits an RF signal and analyzes its reflections off a person's body to recognize his emotional state (happy, sad, etc.). The key enabler underlying EQ-Radio is a new algorithm for extracting the individual heartbeats from the wireless signal at an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. The resulting beats are then used to compute emotion-dependent features which feed a machine-learning emotion classifier.

In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4 degrees, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.";"[Wei, Teng; Zhang, Xinyu] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1415 Johnson Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"Wei, T (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1415 Johnson Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.";"twei7@wisc.edu; xyzhang@ece.wisc.edu";NA;"Zhang, Xinyu/0000-0001-9688-8056";"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1506657, CNS-1518728, CNS1343363, CNS-1350039]";"We appreciate the insightful feedback from the anonymous reviewers who helped improving this work.

However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand landmarks, especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, overclocks its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96%) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4%), and under various practical usage disturbances.";"[Chen, Wenqiang; Chen, Lin; Huang, Yandao; Wang, Lu; Ruby, Rukhsana; Wu, Kaishun] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinyu] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA";"Chen, WQ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.";"chenwenqiang2016@email.szu.edu.cn; chenlin@email.szu.edu.cn; huangyandao@email.szu.edu.cn; xyzhang@ucsd.edu; wanglu@szu.edu.cn; ruby@szu.edu.cn; wu@szu.edu.cn";NA;"Zhang, Xinyu/0000-0001-9688-8056";"China NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61872248, 61472259, 61872246, 61502313]; Joint Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1736207]; Guangdong Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030312008]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation [JCYJ20170302140946299, JCYJ20170412110753954, JCYJ20170817095418831]; Fok YingTong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of ChinaFok Ying Tung Education Foundation [161064]; Guangdong Talent Project [2015TX01X111]; TencentRhinoceros Birds-Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University; GDUPS; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking (TANK), School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin China";"This research was supported in part by the China NSFC Grant 61872248, 61472259, 61872246, 61502313, Joint Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1736207), Guangdong Natural Science Foundation 2017A030312008, Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation (No. JCYJ20170302140946299, JCYJ20170412110753954, JCYJ20170817095418831), Fok YingTong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China(Grant No. 161064), Guangdong Talent Project 2015TX01X111, TencentRhinoceros Birds-Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University and GDUPS (2015).

To scale up to a larger problem size, CROSSSENSE adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen.

Finally, we propose new mechanisms, through which CDNs can safely transition mobile content to IPv6-enabled servers for improved content delivery.";"[Goel, Utkarsh; Wittie, Mike P.] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Steiner, Moritz; Flack, Martin; Ludin, Stephen] Akamai Technol Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA";"Goel, U (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.";"utkarsh.goel@montana.edu; moritz@akamai.com; mwittie@cs.montana.edu; mflack@akamai.com; sludin@akamai.com";NA;NA;"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF CNS-1555591, NSF CNS-1527097]";"We thank Ruomei Gao, Ajay Kumar Miyyapuram, Erik Nygren, Kanika Shah, our shepherd, Matt Welsh, and the anonymous reviewers for providing us constructive feedback.

Offloading DNN inference to an edge server is a promising solution, but limited wireless bandwidth bottlenecks its end-to-end performance and scalability. While IoT devices can adopt source compression to cope with the limited bandwidth, existing compression algorithms (or codecs) are not designed for DNN (but for human eyes), and thus, suffer from either low compression rates or high DNN inference errors. This paper presents GRACE, a DNN-aware compression algorithm that facilitates the edge inference by significantly saving the network bandwidth consumption without disturbing the inference performance. Given a target DNN, GRACE (i) analyzes DNN's perception model w.r.t both spatial frequencies and colors and (ii) generates an optimized compression strategy for the model - one-time offline process. Next, GRACE deploys thus-generated compression strategy at IoT devices (or source) to perform online source compression within the existing codec framework, adding no extra overhead. We prototype GRACE on JPEG (the most popular image codec framework), and our evaluation results show that GRACE indeed achieves the superior compression performance over existing strategies for key DNN applications. For semantic segmentation tasks, GRACE reduces a source size by 23% compared to JPEG with similar interference accuracy (0.38% lower than GRACE). Further, GRACE even achieves 7.5% higher inference accuracy than JPEG with a commonly used quality level of 75 does. For classification tasks, GRACE reduces the bandwidth consumption by 90% over JPEG with the same inference accuracy.";"[Xie, Xiufeng; Kim, Kyu-Han] Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA";"Xie, XF (corresponding author), Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.";"xiufeng.xie@hpe.com; kyu-han.kim@hpe.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;46;0;0;0;0;"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY";"NEW YORK";"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA";NA;NA;"978-1-4503-6169-9";NA;NA;NA;2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"10.1145/3300061.3345448";NA;NA;16;"Telecommunications";"Telecommunications";"BO6KM";"WOS:000521112500022";NA;NA;NA;NA;"2020-09-24";NA;"MOBICOM"

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future in which a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in soil sensing equipments.";"[Ding, Jian] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Chandra, Ranveer] Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA 98052 USA";"Ding, J (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.";NA;NA;NA;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1518916]";"We sincerely thank our shepherd, Domenico Giustiniano, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.

MP-H2 strategically splits the file into byte range requests sent over multipath, and dynamically balances the workload across all paths. Furthermore, MP-H2 leverages new features in HTTP/2 including stream multiplexing, flow control, and application-layer PING to boost the performance.

Apple's FaceID is arguably the latest of such efforts, at the cost of additional hardware (e.g., dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera). We propose a novel user authentication system EchoPrint, which leverages acoustics and vision for secure and convenient user authentication, without requiring any special hardware. EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to illuminate the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries, EchoPrint is not easily spoofed by images or videos like 2D visual face recognition systems. It needs only commodity hardware, thus avoiding the extra costs of special sensors in solutions like FaceID. Experiments with 62 volunteers and non-human objects such as images, photos, and sculptures show that EchoPrint achieves 93.75% balanced accuracy and 93.50% F-score, while the average precision is 98.05%, and no image/video based attack is observed to succeed in spoofing.";"[Zhou, Bing; Ye, Fan] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Lohokare, Jay] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Gao, Ruipeng] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Software Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Zhou, B (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.";"bing.zhou@stonybrook.edu; jay.lohokare@stonybrook.edu; rpgao@bjtu.edu.cn; fan.ye@stonybrook.edu";NA;NA;"US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1730291]; China NSFNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702035]";"We thank our anonymous shepherd and reviewers for their invaluable feedback and comments.

To achieve this, we develop a new approach for meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, which use individual patient data (IPD) from all trials to infer the treatment effect for the patient population in a given trial, based on direct standardization using either outcome regression (OCR) or inverse probability weighting (IPW).

However, gaining access to IPD can be a laborious task (if possible at all) and in practice only summary (aggregate) data are commonly available. In this work we focus on meta-analytic approaches of comparative studies where aggregate data are available for continuous outcomes measured at baseline (pre-treatment) and follow-up (post-treatment). We propose a method for constructing pseudo individual baselines and outcomes based on the aggregate data. These pseudo IPD can be subsequently analysed using standard analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods. Pseudo IPD for continuous outcomes reported at two timepoints can be generated using the sufficient statistics of an ANCOVA model, i.e., the mean and standard deviation at baseline and follow-up per group, together with the correlation of the baseline and follow-up measurements. Applying the ANCOVA approach, which crucially adjusts for baseline imbalances and accounts for the correlation between baseline and change scores, to the pseudo IPD, results in identical estimates to the ones obtained by an ANCOVA on the true IPD. In addition, an interaction term between baseline and treatment effect can be added. There are several modeling options available under this approach, which makes it very flexible. Methods are exemplified using reported data of a previously published IPD meta-analysis of 10 trials investigating the effect of antihypertensive treatments on systolic blood pressure, leading to identical results compared with the true IPD analysis and of a meta-analysis of fewer trials, where baseline imbalance occurred.";"[Papadimitropoulou, Katerina; Dekkers, Olaf M.; le Cessie, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Clin Epidemiol, Med Ctr, Leiden, Zuid Holland, Netherlands; [Papadimitropoulou, Katerina] Danone Nutricia Res, Data Sci & Biometr, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stijnen, Theo; le Cessie, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Biomed Data Sci, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Riley, Richard D.] Keele Univ, Ctr Prognosis Res, Res Inst Primary Care & Hlth Sci, Keele, Staffs, England";"Papadimitropoulou, K (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Clin Epidemiol, Med Ctr, Leiden, Zuid Holland, Netherlands.";"a.papadimitropoulou@lumc.nl";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;46;0;0;1;1;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Our objective was to identify problems in the design and reporting of search strategies in a sample of new Cochrane SRs first published in The Cochrane Library in 2015. Study design and setting: We took a random sample of 70 new Cochrane SRs of interventions published in 2015. We evaluated their design and reporting of search strategies using the recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews, and the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies evidence-based guideline. Results: Most reviews complied with the reporting standards in the Cochrane Handbook and the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews; however, 8 SRs did not search trials registers, 3 SRs included language restrictions, and there was inconsistent reporting of contact with individuals and searches of the gray literature. We found problems in the design of the search strategies in 73% of reviews (95% CI, 60-84%) and 53% of these contained problems (95% CI, 38-69%) that could limit both the sensitivity and precision of the search strategies. Conclusion: We found limitations in the design and reporting of search strategies. We consider that a greater adherence to the guidelines could improve their quality.";"[Ariel Franco, Juan Victor; Laura Garrote, Virginia; Escobar Liquitay, Camila Micaela; Vietto, Valeria] Inst Univ Hosp Italiano, Ctr Cochrane Argentina, Potosi 4234,C1199ACL, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Laura Garrote, Virginia; Escobar Liquitay, Camila Micaela] Inst Univ Hosp Italiano, Biblioteca Cent, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ariel Franco, Juan Victor; Vietto, Valeria] Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Serv Med Familiar & Comunitaria, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina";"Franco, JVA (corresponding author), Inst Univ Hosp Italiano, Ctr Cochrane Argentina, Potosi 4234,C1199ACL, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.";"juan.franco@hospitalitaliano.org.ar";"Franco, Juan/J-5671-2019";"Franco, Juan/0000-0003-0411-899X; Garrote, Virginia/0000-0002-7328-6228";"T.C.

If heterogeneity between the results of the relevant studies is anticipated, then a random-effects model is often preferred for analysis. In this model, a prediction interval for the true effect in a new study also provides additional useful information. However, the DerSimonian and Laird method-frequently used as the default method for meta-analyses with random effects-has been long challenged due to its unfavorable statistical properties. Several alternative methods have been proposed that may have better statistical properties in specific scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of available methods for calculating point estimates, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals for the overall effect size under the random-effects model.

While the purpose of visualization is clear in the pairwise setting, additional treatments broaden the focus and extend the results to be illustrated in network meta-analysis. The complexity increases further in situations where all potential contrasts in the network are compared to a predefined fixed value of interest, such as the 95% coverage evaluated against the nominal value of 95% in simulation studies. We propose utilizing radar graphs to illustrate results from network meta-analysis in cases where the interest lies in the comparison of estimated results (after fitting a network meta-analysis in a specific data set) or a performance measure (simulation study) to a pre-defined fixed reference value. Accounting for the complex high-dimensional data structure, the general picture of the full network is captured at once without increasing the space needed for visualization. Especially in large simulation studies, where multiple scenarios need to be visually combined to gain an overview on different scenarios, this type of illustration facilitates the discussion of results. Further properties, such as the expected variation due to the Monte-Carlo error or the differentiation between directly and indirectly estimated treatment contrasts in simulation studies, as well as the indication of well-connected and sparsely connected treatments in an applied network meta-analysis, can additionally be included in the visualization.

However, network meta-analyses may exhibit inconsistency, where direct and different forms of indirect evidence are not in agreement with each other, even after allowing for between-study heterogeneity. Models for network meta-analysis with random inconsistency effects have the dual aim of allowing for inconsistencies and estimating average treatment effects across the whole network. To date, two classical estimation methods for fitting this type of model have been developed: a method of moments that extends DerSimonian and Laird's univariate method and maximum likelihood estimation. However, the Paule and Mandel estimator is another recommended classical estimation method for univariate meta-analysis. In this paper, we extend the Paule and Mandel method so that it can be used to fit models for network meta-analysis with random inconsistency effects. We apply all three estimation methods to a variety of examples that have been used previously and we also examine a challenging new dataset that is highly heterogenous. We perform a simulation study based on this new example. We find that the proposed Paule and Mandel method performs satisfactorily and generally better than the previously proposed method of moments because it provides more accurate inferences. Furthermore, the Paule and Mandel method possesses some advantages over likelihood-based methods because it is both semiparametric and requires no convergence diagnostics. Although restricted maximum likelihood estimation remains the gold standard, the proposed methodology is a fully viable alternative to this and other estimation methods.";"[Jackson, Dan; Law, Martin] MRC, Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England; [Veroniki, Areti Angeliki; Tricco, Andrea C.] Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Epidemiol Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Baker, Rose] Univ Salford, Manchester, Lancs, England";"Jackson, D (corresponding author), MRC, Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England.";"daniel.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk";"Tricco, Andrea/B-9920-2011";"Tricco, Andrea/0000-0002-4114-8971";"UK Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [U105260558]";"UK Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: U105260558";NA;39;8;8;0;2;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

In contrast to most clinical and epidemiological trials, raw data are often available for high-dimensional expression data. Therefore, direct data merging followed by a joint analysis of selected studies can be an alternative to meta-analysis by P value or effect-size merging or, more generally spoken, the merging of results. While several methods for meta-analysis of differential expression studies have been proposed, meta-analysis of gene set tests has very rarely been considered, although gene set tests are standard in the analysis of individual gene expression studies. We compare in this work the different strategies of research synthesis of gene set tests, in particularly the early merging of data cleaned from batch effects versus the late merging of individual results. In simulation studies and in examples of manipulated real-world data, we found that in most scenarios, the early merging has a higher sensitivity of detecting a gene set enrichment than the late merging. However, in scenarios with few studies, large batch effect, moderate and large sample sizes of late merging are more sensitive than early merging.";"[Kosch, Robin; June, Klaus] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Anim Breeding & Genet, Bunteweg 17p, D-30559 Hannover, Germany";"June, K (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Anim Breeding & Genet, Bunteweg 17p, D-30559 Hannover, Germany.";"klaus.jung@tiho-hannover.de";NA;NA;"Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany";"Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany, Grant/Award Number: N-RENNT";NA;45;1;1;0;2;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

These have the potential to introduce statistical dependency into the meta-analytic data set. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on dealing with effect size multiplicity within studies in the context of meta-analyses of intervention and association studies, recommending a three-step approach. The first step is to define the research question and consider the extent to which it mainly reflects interest in mean effect sizes (which we term a convergent approach) or an interest in exploring heterogeneity (which we term a divergent approach). A second step is to identify the types of multiplicities that appear in the initial database of effect sizes relevant to the research question, and we propose a categorization scheme to differentiate them. The third step is to select a strategy for dealing with each type of multiplicity. The researcher can choose between a reductionist meta-analytic approach, which is characterized by inclusion of a single effect size per study, and an integrative approach, characterized by inclusion of multiple effect sizes per study. We present an overview of available analysis strategies for dealing with effect size multiplicity within studies and provide recommendations intended to help researchers decide which strategy might be preferable in particular situations.

MethodsWe used a collection of meta-analyses on binary outcomes collated from a previous work on missing outcome data. To evaluate the accuracy of their extraction, we developed specific criteria pertaining to the reporting of missing outcome data in systematic reviews. Using the most popular methods to handle missing binary outcome data, we investigated the implications of the accuracy of the extracted meta-analysis on the random-effects meta-analysis results. ResultsOf 113 meta-analyses from Cochrane reviews, 60 (53%) were judged as unclearly extracted (ie, no information on the outcome of completers but available information on how missing participants were handled) and 42 (37%) as unacceptably extracted (ie, no information on the outcome of completers as well as no information on how missing participants were handled). For the remaining meta-analyses, it was judged that data were acceptably extracted (ie, information on the completers' outcome was provided for all trials). Overall, unclear extraction overestimated the magnitude of the summary odds ratio and the between-study variance and additionally inflated the uncertainty of both meta-analytical parameters. The only eligible Campbell review was judged as unclear. ConclusionsDepending on the extent of missingness, the reporting quality of the systematic reviews can greatly affect the accuracy of the extracted meta-analyses and by extent, the empirical performance of different methods to handle missingness.";"[Spineli, Loukia M.] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biometrie, Hannover, Germany";"Spineli, LM (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biometrie OE 8410, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.";"spineli.loukia@mh-hannover.de";"Spineli, Loukia/S-9443-2019";"Spineli, Loukia/0000-0001-9515-582X";NA;NA;NA;23;6;6;0;6;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

One component of this approach is a three-level random effects model capable of synthesizing a pooled correlation matrix with dependent correlation coefficients. Another component is a meta-regression that can be used to generate covariate-adjusted correlation coefficients that reduce the influence of selected unevenly distributed moderator variables.

This tutorial illustrates and compares multiple Bayesian synthesis approaches (i.e., integrative data analyses, meta-analyses, data fusion using augmented data-dependent priors, and data fusion using aggregated data-dependent priors) and discusses when and how to use these Bayesian synthesis approaches to combine studies that compare two independent group means or two matched group means. For each approach, fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models with other variants are illustrated with real data. R code is provided to facilitate the implementation of each method and each model.

We aimed at providing a detailed overview of the characteristics and applied methods in recently published SR-HEs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (03/2017) for SR-HEs published since 2015 using validated search filters. We included studies that performed a systematic review of full economic evaluations and searched at least one electronic database. We extracted data in a standardized, beforehand piloted form that was deduced from the items of the PRISMA and CHEERS checklists. Data were extracted by one reviewer, and a 10% random sample was verified by a second. We prepared descriptive statistical measures to describe the SR-HEs. Results: We included 202 SR-HEs. We identified similarities especially in the methods for information retrieval. Study selection, data extraction, and assessment of quality and transferability were frequently not reported or performed without taking measures to reduce errors (eg, independent study selection). A wide range of different tools was applied for critical appraisal. Moreover, the reporting of included economic evaluations and the synthesis of their results showed strong variations. Conclusions: Overall, we identified few common features in the applied methods for SR-HEs. The information retrieval processes are largely standardized, but many studies did not use validated search filters. For the other systematic review steps, the methodological approaches varied. In particular, important challenges seem to be the methodological quality and transferability assessment as well as presentation and (quantitative) synthesis of results. Efforts are needed for increasing standardization, quality of applied methods, and reporting of SR-HEs.";"[Luhnen, Miriam] Witten Herdecke Univ, Fac Hlth, Dept Med, Ostmerheimer Str 200,Haus 38, D-51109 Cologne, Germany; [Luhnen, Miriam; Mathes, Tim] Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care IQWiG, Int Affairs Unit, Cologne, Germany; [Prediger, Barbara] Witten Herdecke Univ, Inst Res Operat Med, Cologne, Germany; [Neugebauer, Edmund A.

We develop a forward search algorithm for identifying outlying and influential studies in meta-analysis models. The forward search algorithm starts by fitting the hypothesized model to a small subset of likely outlier-free studies and proceeds by adding studies into the set one-by-one that are determined to be closest to the fitted model of the existing set. As each study is added to the set, plots of estimated parameters and measures of fit are monitored to identify outliers by sharp changes in the forward plots. We apply the proposed outlier detection method to two real data sets; a meta-analysis of 26 studies that examines the effect of writing-to-learn interventions on academic achievement adjusting for three possible effect modifiers, and a meta-analysis of 70 studies that compares a fluoride toothpaste treatment to placebo for preventing dental caries in children. A simple simulated example is used to illustrate the steps of the proposed methodology, and a small-scale simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

To realize this type of innovation, a meta-analysis of the body of research is necessary to reveal demand-matching concepts. However, both the data deluge and the narrow time constraints for innovation make it impossible to perform such reviews manually. Thus, this paper proposes a specifically adapted Potential Technologies Review approach focusing on automated text mining and information retrieval techniques. The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies-even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real-world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% Work-saved-over Sampling (WSS) with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand-pull innovations. Moreover, it facilitates the updating and closer monitoring of latest findings.

However, little attention has been given to this topic in the epidemiological literature, and goodness of fit is rarely, if ever, assessed in practice. We briefly review the two-stage and one-stage methods used to carry out dose-response meta-analyses. We then illustrate and discuss three tools specifically aimed at testing, quantifying, and graphically evaluating the goodness of fit of dose-response meta-analyses. These tools are the deviance, the coefficient of determination, and the decorrelated residuals-versus-exposure plot. Data from two published meta-analyses are used to show how these three tools can improve the practice of quantitative synthesis of aggregated dose-response data. In fact, evaluating the degree of agreement between model predictions and empirical data can help the identification of dose-response patterns, the investigation of sources of heterogeneity, and the assessment of whether the pooled dose-response relation adequately summarizes the published results.

Study Design: To synthesise existing guidance concerning overview practice, a scoping review was conducted. Four electronic databases were searched with a pre-specified strategy (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015027592) ending October 2015. Included studies needed to describe or develop overview methodology. Data were narratively synthesised to delineate areas highlighted as outstanding challenges or where methodological recommendations conflict. Results: Twenty-four papers met the inclusion criteria. There is emerging debate regarding overlapping systematic reviews; systematic review scope; quality of included research; updating; and synthesizing and reporting results. While three functions for overviews have been proposed-identify gaps, explore heterogeneity, summarize evidence-overviews cannot perform the first; are unlikely to achieve the second and third simultaneously; and can only perform the third under specific circumstances. Namely, when identified systematic reviews meet the following four conditions: (1) include primary trials that do not substantially overlap, (2) match overview scope, (3) are of high methodological quality, and (4) are up-to-date. Conclusion: Considering the intended function of proposed overviews with the corresponding methodological conditions may improve the quality of this burgeoning publication type.

An attractive feature of the multivariate meta-analysis is its ability to account for the dependence between multiple estimates from the same study. However, standard inference procedures for multivariate meta-analysis require the knowledge of within-study correlations, which are usually unavailable. This limits standard inference approaches in practice. Riley et al proposed a working model and an overall synthesis correlation parameter to account for the marginal correlation between outcomes, where the only data needed are those required for a separate univariate random-effects meta-analysis. As within-study correlations are not required, the Riley method is applicable to a wide variety of evidence synthesis situations. However, the standard variance estimator of the Riley method is not entirely correct under many important settings. As a consequence, the coverage of a function of pooled estimates may not reach the nominal level even when the number of studies in the multivariate meta-analysis is large. In this paper, we improve the Riley method by proposing a robust variance estimator, which is asymptotically correct even when the model is misspecified (ie, when the likelihood function is incorrect). Simulation studies of a bivariate meta-analysis, in a variety of settings, show a function of pooled estimates has improved performance when using the proposed robust variance estimator. In terms of individual pooled estimates themselves, the standard variance estimator and robust variance estimator give similar results to the original method, with appropriate coverage. The proposed robust variance estimator performs well when the number of studies is relatively large. Therefore, we recommend the use of the robust method for meta-analyses with a relatively large number of studies (eg, m >= 50). When the sample size is relatively small, we recommend the use of the robust method under the working independence assumption. We illustrate the proposed method through 2 meta-analyses.";"[Hong, Chuan] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Riley, Richard D.] Keele Univ, Res Inst Primary Care & Hlth Sci, Keele, Staffs, England; [Chen, Yong] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"Hong, C (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA.";"chong@hsph.harvard.edu";NA;NA;"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R01LM012607, 1R01AI130460]; MRC Methodology Research Program [MR/J013595/1]";"NIH, Grant/Award Number: 1R01LM012607 and 1R01AI130460; MRC Methodology Research Program, Grant/Award Number: MR/J013595/1";NA;40;2;2;1;8;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

This can explain heterogeneity/inconsistency that arises by pooling studies with different follow-up times and allow inclusion of studies from earlier in drug development. The aim of this study is to explore using simulation: (a) how MBNMA model parameters are affected by the quantity/location of observed time-points across studies/comparisons, (b) how reliably an appropriate MBNMA model can be identified, (c) the robustness of model estimates and predictions under different dataset characteristics. Our results indicate that model parameters for a given treatment comparison are estimated with low mean bias even when no direct evidence was available, provided there was sufficient indirect evidence to estimate the time-course. A staged model selection strategy that selects time-course function, then heterogeneity, then covariance structure, identified the true model most reliably and efficiently. Predictions and parameter estimates from selected models had low mean bias even in the presence of high heterogeneity/correlation between time-points. However, failure to properly account for heterogeneity/correlation could lead to high error in precision of the estimates. Time-course MBNMA provides a statistically robust framework for synthesizing direct and indirect evidence to estimate relative effects and predicted mean responses whilst accounting for time-course and incorporating correlation and heterogeneity. This supports the use of MBNMA in evidence synthesis, particularly when additional studies are available with follow-up times that would otherwise prohibit their inclusion by conventional meta-analysis.";"[Pedder, Hugo; Dias, Sofia; Welton, Nicky J.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Boucher, Martin; Bennetts, Margherita] Pfizer Ltd, Pharmacometr, Sandwich, Kent, England; [Dias, Sofia] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York, N Yorkshire, England";"Pedder, H (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.";"hugo.pedder@bristol.ac.uk";NA;"Welton, Nicky/0000-0003-2198-3205; Pedder, Hugo/0000-0002-7813-3749";"Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/M005232/1, MR/M005615/1]; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust; Pfizer UKPfizer; University of Bristol";"Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: MR/M005232/1, MR/M005615/1; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust; Pfizer UK; University of Bristol";NA;38;0;0;0;0;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Different on-farm trials based on the same experimental design are conducted over several years and sites to test the effectiveness of different innovative management practices aimed at increasing crop productivity and profitability. As a larger amount of historical trial data are being accumulated, data of all the trials require analyses and summarization. Summaries of on-farm trials are usually presented to farmers as individual field reports, which are not optimal for the dissemination of results and decision making. A more practical communication method is needed to enhance result communication and decision making. R Shiny is a new rapidly developing technology for turning R data analyses into interactive web applications. For the first time for on-farm research networks, we developed and launched an interactive web tool called ISOFAST using R Shiny. ISOFAST simultaneously reports all trial results about the same management practice to simplify interpretation of multi-site and multi-year summaries. We used a random-effects model to synthetize treatment differences at both the individual trial and network levels and generate new knowledge for farmers and agronomists. The friendly interface enables users to explore trial summaries, access model outputs, and perform economic analysis at their fingertips. This paper describes a case-study to illustrate how to use the tool and make agronomic management decisions based on the on-farm trial data.

Numerous sequential methods for meta-analysis have been proposed to detect changes and monitor trends in effect sizes so that meta-analysis can be updated when necessary and interpreted based on the time it was conducted. The difficulties of sequential meta-analysis under the random-effects model are caused by dependencies in increments introduced by the estimation of the heterogeneity parameter tau(2). In this paper, we propose the use of a retrospective cumulative sum (CUSUM)-type test with bootstrap critical values. This method allows retrospective analysis of the past trajectory of cumulative effects in random-effects meta-analysis and its visualization on a chart similar to CUSUM chart. Simulation results show that the new method demonstrates good control of Type I error regardless of the number or size of the studies and the amount of heterogeneity.

Statistical methods for the meta-analysis of intervention studies are well established today. Meta-analysis for diagnostic accuracy trials has also been a vivid research area in recent years, which is especially due to the increased complexity of their bivariate outcome of sensitivity and specificity. The situation is even more challenging when single studies report a full ROC curve with several pairs of sensitivity and specificity, each pair for a different threshold. Researchers frequently ignore this information and use only 1 pair of sensitivity and specificity from each study to arrive at meta-analytic estimates. Although methods to deal with the full information have been proposed, they have some disadvantages, eg, the numbers or values of thresholds have to be identical across studies, or the precise values of thresholds are ignored. We propose an approach for the meta-analysis of full ROC curves including the information from all thresholds by using bivariate time-to-event models for interval-censored data with random effects. This approach avoids the problems of previous methods and comes with the additional advantage that it allows for various distributions of the underlying continuous test values. The results from a small simulation study are given, which show that the approach works well in practice.

However, they may also examine the relative variability (variance) of those groups. For such comparisons, two relatively new effect size statistics, the log-transformed variability ratio (the ratio of two standard deviations; lnVR) and the log-transformed coefficients of variation ratio (the ratio of two coefficients of variation; lnCVR) are useful. In practice, lnCVR may be of most use because a treatment may affect the mean and the variance simultaneously. We propose new estimators for lnCVR and lnVR, including for when the two groups are dependent (eg, cross-over and pre-test-post-test designs). Through simulation, we evaluated the bias of these estimators and make recommendations accordingly. We use the methods to demonstrate that: (a) lifestyle interventions have a heterogenizing effect on gestational weight gain in obese women and (b) low-glycemic index (GI) diets have a homogenizing effect on glycemic control in diabetics. We also find that the degree to which dependence among samples is accounted for can impact parameters such as tau(2)(ie, the between-study variance) andI(2)(ie, the proportion of the total variability due to between-study variance), and even the overall effect, and associated qualitative interpretations. Meta-analytic comparison of the variability between two groups enables us to ask completely new questions and to gain fresh insights from existing datasets.

A typical way of drawing networks, also implemented in statistical software for network meta-analysis, is a circular representation, often with many crossing lines. We use methods from graph theory in order to generate network plots in an automated way. We give a number of requirements for graph drawing and present an algorithm that fits prespecified ideal distances between the nodes representing the treatments. The method was implemented in the function netgraph of the R package netmeta and applied to a number of networks from the literature.

However, within the context of meta-analysis, synthesis methods for such models have not been developed in a commensurate trend. One of the difficulties hindering the development is the disparity in sets of covariates among literature models. If the sets of covariates differ across models, interpretation of coefficients will differ, thereby making it difficult to synthesize them. Moreover, previous synthesis methods for regression models, such as multivariate meta-analysis, often have problems because covariance matrix of coefficients (i.e. within-study correlations) or individual patient data are not necessarily available. This study, therefore, proposes a brief explanation regarding a method to synthesize linear regression models under different covariate sets by using a generalized least squares method involving bias correction terms. Especially, we also propose an approach to recover (at most) three-correlations of covariates, which is required for the calculation of the bias term without individual patient data.

Fixed-effects inference typically centers on measures of association such as the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic or Woolf's estimator, but relies on assuming exact homogeneity across studies, which is often unrealistic. By showing that estimators of several widely-used methods have meaningful estimands even in the presence of heterogeneity, we derive improved confidence intervals for them under heterogeneity. These improvements over current methods are illustrated by simulation, and we also study which factors affect the coverage levels. We find that our confidence intervals provide coverage closer to the nominal level when heterogeneity is present, in both small and large-sample settings. The conventional confidence intervals derived under homogeneity are often conservative, though anti-conservative inferences occur in some scenarios. We also apply the proposed methods to a meta-analysis of 19 randomized clinical trials on the effect of sclerotherapy in preventing first bleeding for patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices.

Bias arising from studies with incomplete outcome data is naturally propagated in a meta-analysis. Conventional analysis using only individuals with available data is adequate when the meta-analyst can be confident that the data are missing at random (MAR) in every study-that is, that the probability of missing data does not depend on unobserved variables, conditional on observed variables. Usually, such confidence is unjustified as participants may drop out due to lack of improvement or adverse effects. The MAR assumption cannot be tested, and a sensitivity analysis to assess how robust results are to reasonable deviations from the MAR assumption is important. Two methods may be used based on plausible alternative assumptions about the missing data. Firstly, the distribution of reasons for missing data may be used to impute the missing values. Secondly, the analyst may specify the magnitude and uncertainty of possible departures from the missing at random assumption, and these may be used to correct bias and reweight the studies. This is achieved by employing a pattern mixture model and describing how the outcome in the missing participants is related to the outcome in the completers. Ideally, this relationship is informed using expert opinion. The methods are illustrated in two examples with binary and continuous outcomes.

A collection of papers that reported data on nondrug adverse effects was sought from included studies of systematic reviews. Each included study was analysed to ascertain whether the corresponding record in MEDLINE and Embase included adverse effects terms in the title, abstract, or indexing. From 9129 records screened from DARE, 30 reviews evaluating nondrug adverse effects met our inclusion criteria. From these, 635 unique papers were included in our analysis. Sensitive searches for adverse effects required generic and specific named adverse effects terms using the title, abstract, and indexing. Records relating to surgical interventions were more likely to contain adverse effects terms than records relating to nonsurgical interventions. Using any adverse effects terms in the title, abstract or indexing in MEDLINE and Embase would have identified an average of 94% of papers on surgical adverse effect interventions per systematic review and 72% of papers on nonsurgical adverse effects per systematic review.

In a seminal article, Ioannidis and Trikalinos (2007, Clinical Trials) proposed an omnibus (I&T) test for significance chasing (SC)biases. This test compares the observed number of studies that report statistically significant results, against their expected number based on study power, assuming a common effect size across studies. The current article extends this approach by developing a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP)meta-regression model and test of SC bias, which can diagnose bias at the individual study level. This new BNPtest is based on a flexible model of the predictive distribution of study power, conditionally on study-level covariates which account for study diversity, including diversity due to heterogeneous effect sizes across studies. A test of SC bias proceeds by comparing each study's significant outcome report indicator against its estimated posterior predictive distribution of study power, conditionally on the study's covariates. The BNP model and SC bias test are illustrated through the analyses of 3 meta-analytic data sets and through a simulation study. Software code for the BNP model and test, and the data sets, are provided as Supporting Information.";"[Karabatsos, George] Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Psychol & Math, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Karabatsos, George] Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Karabatsos, George] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA";"Karabatsos, G (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Psychol & Math, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.; Karabatsos, G (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.; Karabatsos, G (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, 1040 W Harrison St MC 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.";"gkarabatsos1@gmail.com";"Karabatsos, George/L-4869-2019";"Karabatsos, George/0000-0003-4243-2285";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1156372]";"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: SES-1156372";NA;66;0;0;1;6;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Here, it was aimed to apply the combination of threshold analysis and GRADE to judge quantitative and qualitative information on risk of bias in antidepressant treatment recommendations. The analysis was based on the data set provided by Cipriani et al. (The Lancet 2018) comparing 21 antidepressants in adult major depressive disorder (MDD). Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (dropout rate) adjusted for the covariate depression severity. The combined approach suggested sensitivity to plausible bias to be largest for antidepressant recommendations top ranked by Cipriani et al., that is, amitriptyline, duloxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine in terms of efficacy and agomelatine, escitalopram, paroxetine, and venlafaxine in terms of acceptability. Covariate ranges within which recommendations were most sensitive to plausible bias were very severe depression in terms of efficacy (smallest threshold, ie, the largest sensitivity, around 39 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS]) and moderate depression in terms of acceptability (smallest thresholds around 16 and 35 HDRS). This indicates that treatment recommendations within these ranges may likely change if plausible bias adjustments take place. The present findings may support decision makers in judging the sensitivity to plausible bias of current antidepressant treatment recommendations to accurately guide treatment decisions in MDD depending on depression severity.";"[Holper, L.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Psychiat Hosp, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland";"Holper, L (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Psychiat Hosp, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.";"lisa.holper@bli.uzh.ch";NA;"Holper, Lisa/0000-0002-2599-3649";NA;NA;NA;37;0;0;0;0;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

We analyzed information sources used in SRs, as well as how up-to-date were the searches. Methods We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) through Wiley from 2012 to 2016 to find SRs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of anesthesiology and pain. We analyzed information sources used and search dates. Results We analyzed 674 SRs, including 374 non-Cochrane SRs (NCSRs) and 300 Cochrane reviews. The most commonly searched electronic databases reported in all included SRs were Embase (88.6%), MEDLINE (78.3%), CENTRAL (76.1%), CINAHL (29.1%), and PubMed (30.9%). In 303 (45%) SRs, authors reported that they searched clinical trial registries; 57 (8.5%) reported that they searched for unpublished data, 184 (27.3%) searched grey literature, 51 (7.6%) searched citations, and 546 (81%) searched references of included studies. A substantial amount of Cochrane reviews searched clinical trial registries (75.7%), compared with NCSRs (20.3%). Search date was reported in 647 SRs (96.1%). The median time between the last search date and publication for the SRs that reported search date was 10 months. For the NCSRs, median time between the last search and publication date was significantly higher compared with Cochrane reviews. Nonreporting of search date was more prevalent in NCSRs. Conclusion SRs in the field of anesthesiology and pain often neglect to search all possible information sources, particularly in NCSRs. Cochrane reviews had more comprehensive searching and shorter search to publication time.";"[Biocic, Marina] Inst Emergency Med Split Dalmatia Cty, Emergency Dept Muc, Split, Croatia; [Fidahic, Mahir] Univ Tuzla, Fac Med, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Cikes, Karla; Puljak, Livia] Catholic Univ Croatia, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Hlth Care, Ilica 242, Zagreb 10000, Croatia";"Puljak, L (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Croatia, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Hlth Care, Ilica 242, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.";"livia.puljak@gmail.com";"Puljak, Livia/D-5080-2017";"Puljak, Livia/0000-0002-8467-6061";NA;NA;NA;31;0;0;0;1;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

In these DTA meta-analyses, some studies may have markedly different characteristics from the others and potentially be inappropriate to include. The inclusion of these outlying studies might lead to biases, yielding misleading results. In addition, there might be influential studies that have notable impacts on the results. In this article, we propose Bayesian methods for detecting outlying studies and their influence diagnostics in DTA meta-analyses. Synthetic influence measures based on the bivariate hierarchical Bayesian random effects models are developed because the overall influences of individual studies should be simultaneously assessed by the two outcome variables and their correlation information. We propose four synthetic measures for influence analyses: (a) relative distance, (b) standardized residual, (c) Bayesian p-value, and (d) influence statistic on the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. We also show that conventional univariate Bayesian influential measures can be applied to the bivariate random effects models, which can be used as marginal influential measures. Most of these methods can be similarly applied to the frequentist framework. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by applying them to a DTA meta-analysis of ultrasound in screening for vesicoureteral reflux among children with urinary tract infections.";"[Matsushima, Yuki] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Multidisciplinary Sci, Dept Stat Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsushima, Yuki] Otsuka Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Dept Biometr, Tokyo, Japan; [Noma, Hisashi] Inst Stat Math, Dept Data Sci, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan; [Yamada, Tomohide] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Diabet & Metab Dis, Tokyo, Japan; [Furukawa, Toshi A.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot & Human Behav, Kyoto, Japan";"Noma, H (corresponding author), Inst Stat Math, Dept Data Sci, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan.";"noma@ism.ac.jp";NA;"Matsushima, Yuki/0000-0002-6868-2699";"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP17K19808, JP19H04074]";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Grant/Award Numbers: JP17K19808, JP19H04074";NA;25;0;0;2;2;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Standard indirect comparisons use only aggregate data, under the assumption that there are no differences in effect-modifying variables between the trial populations. Population-adjusted indirect comparisons aim to relax this assumption by using individual patient data (IPD) from one trial to adjust for differences in effect modifiers between populations. At present, the most commonly used approach is matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), where weights are estimated that match the covariate distributions of the reweighted IPD to the aggregate trial. MAIC was originally proposed using the method of moments to estimate the weights, but more recently entropy balancing has been proposed as an alternative. Entropy balancing has an additional optimality property ensuring that the weights are as uniform as possible, reducing the standard error of the estimates. In this brief method note, we show that MAIC weights are mathematically identical whether estimated using entropy balancing or the method of moments. Importantly, this means that the standard MAIC (based on the method of moments) also enjoys the optimality property. Moreover, the additional flexibility of entropy balancing suggests several interesting avenues for further research, such as combining population adjustment via MAIC with adjustments for treatment switching or nonparametric covariate adjustment.";"[Phillippo, David M.; Dias, Sofia; Ades, A.

For example, some may report numbers of patients with at least one of each outcome while others may report the total number of such outcomes. We develop a shared parameter model on hazard ratio scale accounting for different data summaries and competing risks. We adapt theoretical arguments from the literature to demonstrate that the models are equivalent if events are rare. We use constructed data examples and a simulation study to find an event rate threshold of approximately 0.2 above which competing risks and different data summaries may bias results if no adjustments are made. Below this threshold, simpler models may be sufficient. We recommend analysts to consider the absolute event rates and only use a simple model ignoring data types and competing risks if all of underlying events are rare (below our threshold of approximately 0.2). If one or more of the absolute event rates approaches or exceeds our informal threshold, it may be necessary to account for data types and competing risks through a shared parameter model in order to avoid biased estimates.";"[Thom, Howard; Lopez-Lopez, Jose A.; Welton, Nicky J.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lopez-Lopez, Jose A.] Univ Murcia, Fac Psychol, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, Murcia, Spain";"Thom, H (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.";"howard.thom@bristol.ac.uk";"Lopez-Lopez, Jose Antonio/A-2865-2013";"Lopez-Lopez, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-9655-3616; Welton, Nicky/0000-0003-2198-3205; Thom, Howard/0000-0001-8576-5552";"Health Technology Assessment ProgrammeNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [11/92/17]; Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC); National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [11/92/17]";"Health Technology Assessment Programme, Grant/Award Number: 11/92/17; Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Hubs for Trials Methodology Research Collaboration; National Institute for Health Research, Grant/Award Numbers: Biomedical Research Centre at University Hospitals, 11/92/17";NA;39;1;1;0;0;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

However, for complex networks, it is not easy to see if the network is connected. We use simple techniques from graph theory to test the connectedness of evidence networks in network meta-analysis. The method is to build the adjacency matrix for a network, with rows and columns corresponding to the treatments in the network and entries being one or zero depending on whether the treatments have been compared or not, and with zeros along the diagonal. Manipulation of this matrix gives the indirect connection matrix. The entries of this matrix determine whether two treatments can be compared, directly or indirectly. We also describe the distance matrix, which gives the minimum number of steps in the network required to compare a pair of treatments. This is a useful assessment of an indirect comparison as each additional step requires further assumptions of homogeneity in, for example, design and target populations of included trials. If there are no loops in the network, the distance is a measure of the degree of assumptions needed; it is approximately this with loops. We illustrate our methods using several constructed examples and giving R code for computation. We have also implemented the techniques in the Stata package network.

Because statistical tests for publication bias are usually not powerful and only give P values that inform either the presence or absence of the bias, examining the asymmetry of funnel plots has been popular to investigate potentially missing studies and the direction of the bias. Most funnel plots present treatment effects against their standard errors, and the contours depicting studies' significance levels have been used in the plots to distinguish publication bias from other factors (such as heterogeneity and subgroup effects) that may cause the plots' asymmetry. However, treatment effects and their standard errors are frequently associated even if no publication bias exists (eg, both variables depend on the four data cells in a 2 x 2 table for the odds ratio), so standard-error-based funnel plots may lead to false positive conclusions when such association may not be negligible. In addition, the missingness of studies may relate to their sample sizes besides P values (which are partly determined by standard errors); studies with more samples are more likely published. Therefore, funnel plots based on sample sizes can be an alternative tool. However, the contours for standard-error-based funnel plots cannot be directly applied to sample-size-based ones. This article introduces contours for sample-size-based funnel plots of various effect sizes, which may help meta-analysts properly interpret such plots' asymmetry. We provide five examples to illustrate the use of the proposed contours.";"[Lin, Lifeng] Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, 201B OSB,117 N Woodward Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA";"Lin, LF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, 201B OSB,117 N Woodward Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.";"linl@statisu.edu";"Lin, Lifeng/B-6385-2018";"Lin, Lifeng/0000-0002-3562-9816";"AHRQ HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [R03 HS024743]";NA;NA;56;3;3;0;1;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Results based on interpolation or extrapolation may be unreliable. In network meta-regression (NMR) models, which include covariates in network meta-analyses, results are estimated using direct and indirect evidence; therefore, it may be unclear which studies and covariate values contribute to which result. We propose graphs to help understand which trials and covariate values contribute to each NMR result and to highlight extrapolation or interpolation. Methods: We introduce methods to calculate the contribution that each trial and covariate value makes to each result and compare them with existing methods. We show how to construct graphs including a network covariate distribution diagram, covariate-contribution plot, heat plot, contribution-NMR plot, and heat-NMR plot. We demonstrate the methods using a dataset with treatments for malaria using the covariate average age and a dataset of topical fluoride interventions for preventing dental caries using the covariate randomisation year. Results: For the malaria dataset, no contributing trials had an average age between 7-25 years and therefore results were interpolated within this range. For the fluoride dataset, there are no contributing trials randomised between 1954-1959 for most comparisons therefore, within this range, results would be extrapolated. Conclusions: Even in a fully connected network, an NMR result may be estimated from trials with a narrower covariate range than the range of the whole dataset. Calculating contributions and graphically displaying them aids interpretation of NMR result by highlighting extrapolated or interpolated results.";"[Donegan, Sarah; Tudur-Smith, Catrin] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Waterhouse Bldg,1-5 Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GL, Merseyside, England; [Dias, Sofia; Welton, Nicky J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Marinho, Valeria] Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, Inst Dent, 4 Newark St, London E1 2AT, England";"Donegan, S (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Waterhouse Bldg,1-5 Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GL, Merseyside, England.";"sarah.donegan@liverpool.ac.uk";"Dias, Sofia/F-1922-2010";"Dias, Sofia/0000-0002-2172-0221; Welton, Nicky/0000-0003-2198-3205";"Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K021435/1]";"Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: MR/K021435/1";NA;40;2;2;0;9;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

We used hierarchical models to analyse data from 3873 binary, 5132 continuous and 880 mixed outcome meta-analyses within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Predictive distributions for inconsistency expected in future meta-analyses were obtained, which can inform priors for between-study variance. Inconsistency estimates were highest on average for binary outcome meta-analyses of risk differences and continuous outcome meta-analyses. For a planned binary outcome meta-analysis in a general research setting, the predictive distribution for inconsistency among log odds ratios had median 22% and 95% CI: 12% to 39%. For a continuous outcome meta-analysis, the predictive distribution for inconsistency among standardized mean differences had median 40% and 95% CI: 15% to 73%. Levels of inconsistency were similar for binary data measured by log odds ratios and log relative risks. Fitted distributions for inconsistency expected in continuous outcome meta-analyses using mean differences were almost identical to those using standardized mean differences. The empirical evidence on inconsistency gives guidance on which outcome measures are most likely to be consistent in particular circumstances and facilitates Bayesian meta-analysis with an informative prior for heterogeneity.

Approaches based on effect size estimates from each study are generally regarded as the most informative. However, these methods can only be used if comparable effect sizes can be computed from each study, and this may not be the case due to variation in how the studies were done or limitations in how their results were reported. Other methods, such as vote counting, are then used to summarize the results of these studies, but most of these methods are limited in that they do not provide any indication of the magnitude of effect. We propose a novel plot, the albatross plot, which requires only a 1-sided P value and a total sample size from each study (or equivalently a 2-sided P value, direction of effect and total sample size). The plot allows an approximate examination of underlying effect sizes and the potential to identify sources of heterogeneity across studies. This is achieved by drawing contours showing the range of effect sizes that might lead to each P value for given sample sizes, under simple study designs. We provide examples of albatross plots using data from previous meta-analyses, allowing for comparison of results, and an example from when a meta-analysis was not possible.";"[Harrison, Sean; Jones, Hayley E.; Martin, Richard M.; Lewis, Sarah J.; Higgins, Julian P.

In this third of three reviews, we examine the applications that have been used in the literature to predict real-world effectiveness from randomized controlled trial efficacy data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE from inception to March 2014, the Cochrane Methodology Register, and websites of key journals and organisations and reference lists. We extracted data on the type of model and predictions, data sources, validation and sensitivity analyses, disease area and software. We identified 12 articles in which four approaches were used: multi-state models, discrete event simulation models, physiology-based models and survival and generalized linear models. Studies predicted outcomes over longer time periods in different patient populations, including patients with lower levels of adherence or persistence to treatment or examined doses not tested in trials. Eight studies included individual patient data. Seven examined cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and three neurological conditions. Most studies included sensitivity analyses, but external validation was performed in only three studies. We conclude that mathematical modelling to predict real-world effectiveness of drug interventions is notwidely used at present and not well validated.

All three documents recommended the use of two forms of graphical presentation: (a) forest plots displaying meta-analysis results for sensitivity (ie, the true positive rate) and specificity (ie, true negative rate) separately, and (b) Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve to provide a global summary of test performance. Two primary shortcomings were identified: (a) lack of incorporation of quality assessment results into the main analysis and; (b) ambiguity with which the contribution of individual studies is represented on SROC curves. In response, two alternative graphical approaches were developed: A quality assessment enhanced SROC plotwhich displays the results from individual studies in the meta-analysis with multiple indicators of quality assessed using QUADAS-2; and A percentage study weights enhanced SROC plotwhich accurately portrays the percentage contribution each study makes to the meta-analysis. The proposed enhanced SROC curves facilitate the exploration of DTA data, leading to a deeper understanding of the primary studies included in a DTA meta-analysis including identifying reasons for between study heterogeneity and why specific study results may be divergent.

This study compared the use of a complete dual review approach, with two reviewers in both the title/abstract screening stage and the full-text screening stage, as compared with a limited dual review approach, with two reviewers only in the full-text stage. Methods This study was performed within the context of a large systematic review. Two reviewers performed a complete dual review of 15 000 search results and a limited dual review of 15 000 search results. The number of relevant studies mistakenly excluded by highly experienced reviewers in the complete dual review was compared with the number mistakenly excluded during the full-text stage of the limited dual review. Results In the complete dual review approach, an additional 6.6% to 9.1% of eligible studies were identified during the title/abstract stage by using two reviewers, and an additional 6.6% to 11.9% of eligible studies were identified during the full-text stage by using two reviewers. In the limited dual review approach, an additional 4.4% to 5.3% of eligible studies were identified with the use of two reviewers.

It examines the association between the observed effect sizes and their sample SEs; a strong association indicates small-study effects. However, its false positive rates may be inflated if such an association intrinsically exists even if no small-study effects appear, particularly in meta-analyses of odds ratios (ORs). Various alternatives are available to address this problem. They usually replace Egger's regression predictor or response with different measures; consequently, they are powerful only in specific cases. We propose a Bayesian approach to assessing small-study effects in meta-analyses of ORs. It controls false positive rates by using latent true SEs, rather than sample SEs, in the Egger-type regression to avoid the intrinsic association between ORs and their SEs. Although true SEs are unknown in practice, they can be modeled under the Bayesian framework. We use simulated and real data to compare various methods. When ORs are away from 1, the proposed method may have high powers with controlled false positive rates, while Egger's test has seriously inflated false positive rates; nevertheless, in other situations, some other methods may be superior. In general, the proposed method may serve as an alternative to rule out potential confounding effects caused by the intrinsic association between ORs and their SEs in the assessment of small-study effects.";"[Shi, Linyu; Lin, Lifeng] Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Chu, Haitao] Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN USA";"Lin, LF (corresponding author), 201B OSB,117 N Woodward Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.";"linl@stat.fsu.edu";"Lin, Lifeng/B-6385-2018";"Lin, Lifeng/0000-0002-3562-9816; Chu, Haitao/0000-0003-0932-598X";"National Center for Advancing Translational SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1 TR001427]; U.S. National Library of MedicineUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) [R01 LM012982]";"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Grant/Award Number: UL1 TR001427; U.S. National Library of Medicine, Grant/Award Number: R01 LM012982";NA;67;0;0;2;2;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Method: Forwards citation searching was performed using GS on a base set of 46 publications and replicated using WOS. Outcomes: WOS and GS were compared in terms of recall; precision; number needed to read (NNR); administrative time and costs; and screening time and costs. Outcomes for all publications were compared with those for a subset of highly important publications. Results: The searches identified 43 relevant publications. The WOS process had 86.05% recall and 1.58% precision. The GS process had 90.7% recall and 1.62% precision. The NNR to identify one relevant publication was 63.3 with WOS and 61.72 with GS. There were nine highly important publications. WOS had 100% recall, 0.38% precision and NNR of 260.22. GS had 88.89% recall, 0.33% precision and NNR of 300.88. Administering the WOS results took 4h and cost 88-136 pound, compared with 75h and 1650- pound 2550 pound with GS. Conclusion: WOS is recommended over GS, as citation searching was more effective, while the administrative and screening times and costs were lower.

This study aimed to investigate the publication rates, timely dissemination of results, and the prevalence of consistency in hypothesis, sample size, and primary endpoint of Dutch investigator-initiated randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Methods All Dutch investigator-initiated RCTs with a completion date between December 31, 2010, and January 1, 2012, and registered in the Trial Register of The Netherlands database were included. PubMed was searched for the publication of these RCT results until September 2016, and the time to the publication date was calculated. Consistency in hypothesis, sample size, and primary endpoint compared with the registry data were assessed. Results The search resulted in a total of 168 Dutch investigator-initiated RCTs. In September 2016, the results of 129 (77%) trials had been published, of which 50 (39%) within 2 years after completion of accrual. Consistency in hypothesis with the original protocol was observed in 108 (84%) RCTs; in 71 trials (55%), the planned sample size was reached; and 103 trials (80%) presented the original primary endpoint. Consistency in all three parameters was observed in 50 studies (39%). Conclusion This study shows that approximately one out of four Dutch investigator-initiated RCTs remains unpublished 5 years after initiation. The observed low overall consistency with the initial study outline is a matter of concern and warrants improvements in trial design and assessment of trial feasibility.";"[Huiskens, Joost; Kool, Boudewijn R.

Public health programs, such as those designed to prevent adolescent risk behavior, are typically considered complex. In conducting a realist review of the empirical literature relating to such programs, we encountered several challenges, including (a) an overabundance of empirical evidence, (b) a problematic level of heterogeneity within and between methodological approaches, (c) discrepancies between theoretical underpinnings and program operationalization, (d) homogeneity of program outcomes, with very little variation in program effectiveness, and (d) a paucity of description relating to content and process. To overcome these challenges, we developed a customized approach to realist evidence synthesis, drawing on the VICTORE (Volition, Implementation, Contexts, Time, Outcomes, Rivalry, and Emergence) complexity checklist and incorporating stakeholder engagement as primary data to achieve greater depth of understanding relating to contextual and mechanistic factors, and the complex interactions between them. Here we discuss the benefits of this adapted methodology alongside an overview of the research through which the methodology was developed. A key finding from this research was that combining the complexity checklist with primary data from stakeholder engagement enabled us to systematically interrogate the data across data sources, uncovering and evidencing mechanisms which may otherwise have remained hidden, giving greater ontological depth to our research findings. This paper builds on key methodological developments in realist research, demonstrating how realist methodologies can be customized to overcome challenges in developing and refining program theory from the literature, and contributes to the broader literature of innovative approaches to realist research. Highlights Published reporting standards for realist review provide a set of guiding principles for conducting realist research. However, these are not recommended to be used in a prescriptive sense, and customization of the methodology to account for potential idiosyncrasies within a specific evidence base is accepted. A small number of papers within the existing literature have used each of the two key adaptions discussed within this study, though reasons for doing so have not been considered in any great depth. Furthermore, combining both of these adaptions to take an evaluative approach to realist synthesis is novel to this work and lends greater ontological depth to the research findings than may otherwise have been achieved. This study builds on key methodological developments in realist research, demonstrating how realist methodologies can be customized to overcome challenges in developing and refining program theory from the literature, and contributes to the broader literature of innovative approaches to realist research.";"[Cooper, Christina; Lhussier, Monique; Carr, Susan] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Work Educ & Community Wellbeing, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England";"Cooper, C (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Work Educ & Community Wellbeing, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.";"christina.a.cooper@northumbria.ac.uk";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;65;0;0;0;0;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

However, the heterogeneity is difficult to estimate if only very few studies are included. Motivated by a systematic review in immunosuppression following liver transplantation in children, we investigate the properties of a range of commonly used frequentist and Bayesian procedures in simulation studies. Furthermore, the consequences for interval estimation of the common treatment effect in random-effects meta-analysis are assessed. The Bayesian credibility intervals using weakly informative priors for the between-trial heterogeneity exhibited coverage probabilities in excess of the nominal level for a range of scenarios considered. However, they tended to be shorter than those obtained by the Knapp-Hartung method, which were also conservative. In contrast, methods based on normal quantiles exhibited coverages well below the nominal levels in many scenarios. With very few studies, the performance of the Bayesian credibility intervals is of course sensitive to the specification of the prior for the between-trial heterogeneity. In conclusion, the use of weakly informative priors as exemplified by half-normal priors (with a scale of 0.5 or 1.0) for log odds ratios is recommended for applications in rare diseases.

The usefulness of pairwise meta-analysis is thus limited in real-life medical practice, where many competing interventions may be available for a certain condition and studies informing some of the pairwise comparisons may be lacking. This commonly encountered scenario has led to the development of network meta-analysis (NMA). In the last decade, several applications, methodological developments, and empirical studies in NMA have been published, and the area is thriving as its relevance to public health is increasingly recognized.

Evidence of publication bias is mounting in virtually all fields of empirical research. This paper proposes the endogenous kink (EK) meta-regression model as a novel method of publication bias correction. The EK method fits a piecewise linear meta-regression of the primary estimates on their standard errors, with a kink at the cutoff value of the standard error below which publication selection is unlikely. We provide a simple method of endogenously determining this cutoff value as a function of a first-stage estimate of the true effect and an assumed threshold of statistical significance. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that EK is less biased and more efficient than other related regression-based methods of publication bias correction in a variety of research conditions.";"[Bom, Pedro R.

This is inevitably the case under a fixed-effect model. However, the inclusion of the between-study variance in the random-effects model, and the need to estimate this parameter, can have unfortunate implications for this power. We develop methods for assessing the power of random-effects meta-analyses, and the average power of the individual studies that contribute to meta-analyses, so that these powers can be compared. In addition to deriving new analytical results and methods, we apply our methods to 1991 meta-analyses taken from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to retrospectively calculate their powers. We find that, in practice, 5 ormore studies are needed to reasonably consistently achieve powers from random-effects meta-analyses that are greater than the studies that contribute to them. Not only is statistical inference under the random-effects model challenging when there are very fewstudies but also lessworthwhile in such cases.

We trained and optimized support vector machine and convolutional neural network models on the titles and abstracts of the Cochrane Crowd RCT set. We evaluated the models on an external dataset (Clinical Hedges), allowing direct comparison with traditional database search filters. We estimated area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) using the Clinical Hedges dataset. We demonstrate that ML approaches better discriminate between RCTs and non-RCTs than widely used traditional database search filters at all sensitivity levels; our best-performing model also achieved the best results to date for ML in this task (AUROC 0.987, 95% CI, 0.984-0.989).

However, inference about between-study variability, which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic' to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Firstly, we conducted assessment for publication bias in nine meta-analyses of postoperative analgesics (344 trials with 25 348 participants). Secondly, we attempted to resolve the observed asymmetry by considering meta-regression residuals as outcome (rather than mean difference) and (inverse) sample size as the exploratory variable (rather than SE). Since the approach resolved the asymmetry, we evaluated it, and related approaches, using a simulation study considering four scenarios comprised of every combination of baseline interactions and absolute selective publication bias being present or not (10 000 simulated meta-analyses per scenario with no residual between-study heterogeneity). The test based on meta-regression residuals and inverse sample size performed as well as conventional tests (Egger's test) when no baseline risk was present and reduced type I errors when baseline risk was present. It also had modest power to detect publication bias in the presence of baseline risk. We demonstrated that correlation between effect estimates and SEs produces funnel plot asymmetry in the presence of no publication bias for continuous outcomes dependent on baseline risk. Our novel approach of assessing funnel plot asymmetry using a modified funnel plot and test based on residuals and inverse sample size may have improved performance when carrying out publication bias assessments for unstandardized mean differences where treatment effects are dependent on baseline risk.";"[Doleman, Brett; Lund, Jonathan N.; Williams, John P.] Univ Nottingham, Royal Derby Hosp, Dept Surg & Anaesthesia, Derby, England; [Freeman, Suzanne C.; Sutton, Alex J.] Univ Leicester, Coll Med, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England";"Doleman, B (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Div Med Sci & Grad Entry Med, Royal Derby Hosp, Derby DE22 3DT, England.";"dr.doleman@gmail.com";"; Lund, Jonathan/A-3981-2019";"Doleman, Brett/0000-0003-4707-4755; Lund, Jonathan/0000-0001-5195-2181";"Department of Health; National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR)";"Department of Health; National Institute for Health Research";NA;31;0;0;0;0;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Despite much progress, however, a number of problems remain, including slow integration of new statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here, I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and deduplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects.";"[Westgate, Martin J.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia";"Westgate, MJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.";"martin.westgate@anu.edu.au";NA;"Westgate, Martin/0000-0003-0854-2034";"International Outgoing Visiting Fellowship - Australian Research Councils' Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions";"N.

Objective: To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of BinaxNOW-SP and subsequently estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding BinaxNOW-SP to the diagnostic work-up. Design: We fit a Bayesian latent-class meta-analysis model to obtain estimates of BinaxNOW-SP accuracy that adjust for the imperfect accuracy of culture. Metaanalysis results were combined with information on prevalence of SP pneumonia to estimate the number of patients who are correctly classified under competing diagnostic strategies. Taking into consideration the cost of antibiotics, we determined the incremental cost of adding BinaxNOW-SP to the work-up per case correctly diagnosed. Results: The BinaxNOW-SP test had a pooled sensitivity of 0.74 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.67-0.83) and a pooled specificity of 0.96 (95% CrI, 0.92-0.99). An overall increase in diagnostic accuracy of 6.2% due to the addition of BinaxNOW-SP corresponded to an incremental cost per case correctly classified of $ 582 Canadian dollars.

Little is known about how this expedited process affects results. ObjectivesTo assess differences between rapid and systematic review approaches for a case study of test accuracy of succinylacetone for detecting tyrosinemia type 1. MethodsTwo reviewers conducted an enhanced rapid review then a systematic review. The enhanced rapid review involved narrower searches, a single reviewer checking 20% of titles/abstracts and data extraction, and quality assessment using an unadjusted QUADAS-2. Two reviewers performed the systematic review with a tailored QUADAS-2. Post hoc analysis examined rapid reviewing with a single reviewer (basic rapid review). ResultsTen papers were included. Basic rapid reviews would have missed 1 or 4 of these (dependent on which reviewer). Enhanced rapid and systematic reviews identified all 10 papers; one paper was only identified in the rapid review through reference checking. Two thousand one hundred seventy-six fewer title/abstracts and 129 fewer full texts were screened during the enhanced rapid review than the systematic review. The unadjusted QUADAS-2 generated more unclear ratings than the adjusted QUADAS-2 [29/70 (41.4%) versus 16/70 (22.9%)], and fewer high ratings [22/70 (31.4%) versus 42/70 (60.0%)]. Basic rapid reviews contained important inaccuracies in data extraction, which were detected by a second reviewer in the enhanced rapid and systematic reviews.

Individual participant data (IPD) network meta-analysis (NMA) models have greater power than individual trials to identify treatment-covariate interactions (TCIs). Treatment-covariate interactions contain within and across trial interactions, where the across-trial interaction is more susceptible to confounding and ecological bias. Methods: We considered a network of IPD from 37 trials (5922 patients) for cervical cancer (2394 events), where previous research identified disease stage as a potential interaction covariate. We compare 2 models for NMA with TCIs: (1) 2 effects separating within- and across-trial interactions and (2) a single effect combining within- and across-trial interactions. We argue for a visual assessment of consistency of within- and across-trial interactions and consider more detailed aspects of interaction modelling, eg, common vs trial-specific effects of the covariate. This leads us to propose a practical framework for IPD NMA with TCIs. Results: Following our framework, we found no evidence in the cervical cancer network for a treatment-stage interaction on the basis of the within-trial interaction. The NMA provided additional power for an across-trial interaction over and above the pairwise evidence. Following our proposed framework, we found that the within- and across-trial interactions should not be combined. Conclusion: Across-trial interactions are susceptible to confounding and ecological bias. It is important to separate the sources of evidence to check their consistency and identify which sources of evidence are driving the conclusion. Our framework provides practical guidance for researchers, reducing the risk of unduly optimistic interpretation of TCIs.";"[Freeman, S. C.; Fisher, D.; Tierney, J. F.; Carpenter, J.

Consequently, there is an increasing use of meta-analytic methods to combine evidence from studies that estimate the parameters of structural equation models. Two approaches are used to combine evidence from structural equation models: A direct approach that combines structural coefficients and an indirect approach that first combines correlation matrices and estimates structural coefficients from the combined correlation matrix. When there is no heterogeneity across studies, direct estimates of structural coefficients from several studies is an appealing approach. Heterogeneity of correlation matrices across studies presents both practical and conceptual problems. An alternative approach to heterogeneity is suggested as an example of how to better handle heterogeneity in this context.

Potential inconsistencies between estimates of relative treatment effects are an important concern, and several methods to detect inconsistency have been proposed. This paper is concerned with the node-splitting approach, which is particularly attractive because of its straightforward interpretation, contrasting estimates from both direct and indirect evidence. However, node-splitting analyses are labour-intensive because each comparison of interest requires a separate model. It would be advantageous if node-splitting models could be estimated automatically for all comparisons of interest. We present an unambiguous decision rule to choose which comparisons to split, and prove that it selects only comparisons in potentially inconsistent loops in the network, and that all potentially inconsistent loops in the network are investigated. Moreover, the decision rule circumvents problems with the parameterisation of multi-arm trials, ensuring that model generation is trivial in all cases. Thus, our methods eliminate most of the manual work involved in using the node-splitting approach, enabling the analyst to focus on interpreting the results.

Estimates of this so-called between-study variance are usually imprecise. Hence, reporting a confidence interval together with a point estimate of the amount of between-study variance facilitates interpretation of the meta analytic results. Two methods that are recommended to be used for creating such a confidence interval are the Q-profile and generalized Q-statistic method that both make use of the Q-statistic. These methods are exact if the assumptions underlying the random-effects model hold, but these assumptions are usually violated in practice such that confidence intervals of the methods are approximate rather than exact confidence intervals. We illustrate by means of two Monte-Carlo simulation studies with odds ratio as effect size measure that coverage probabilities of both methods can be substantially below the nominal coverage rate in situations that are representative for meta-analyses in practice. We also show that these too low coverage probabilities are caused by violations of the assumptions of the random-effects model (ie, normal sampling distributions of the effect size measure and known sampling variances) and are especially prevalent if the sample sizes in the primary studies are small.";"[van Aert, Robbie C.

Meta-analysis on the transcriptomics profiles were conducted using p-value-based, rank-based, and effect size-based algorithms. The application of our approach was demonstrated using partially paired data from psoriasis transcriptomics studies. Upon combining six transcriptomics studies, genes related to the cell cycle and DNA replication pathways are found to be highly perturbed in psoriatic lesional skin samples. Results were validated externally with independent RNA-Seq data. Comparison with existing pathway meta-analysis methods revealed consistent results, with our method showing higher detection power.

This study aimed to report on the conduct and reporting of backward citation searching (ie, checking reference lists) and forward citation searching in a cross section of Cochrane reviews. Citation searching uses the citation network surrounding a source study to identify additional studies. Methods Cochrane reviews were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the wildcard symbol and date limiting to the 3-month period November 2016 to January 2017. Cochrane reviews thus identified were screened for mention of citation searching. Descriptive detail on the conduct and reporting of citation searching was captured in data extraction forms and described and evaluated. Results Two hundred fifteen Cochrane reviews were identified. One hundred seventy-two reviews reported backward citation searching, and 18 reviews reported forward citation searching. Web of Science was the most frequently reported citation index. The studies used for backward citation searching consisted mainly of studies meeting the inclusion criteria. One-third of reviews that reported forward citation searching used selected studies of importance. Reporting of citation searching was compliant with the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards, but full transparency requires additional detail that only a minority of reviews reported. Conclusion The conduct of backward citation searching was more uniform than forward citation searching. This might be due to lack of MECIR guidance for forward citation searching.

Existing data abstraction systems do not track specific locations and contexts of abstracted information. To address this limitation, we developed a software application, the Data Abstraction Assistant (DAA) and surveyed early users about their experience using DAA. Features of DAA We designed DAA to encompass three essential features: (1) a platform for indicating the source of abstracted information, (2) compatibility with a variety of data abstraction systems, and (3) user-friendliness. How DAA functions DAA (1) converts source documents from PDF to HTML format (to enable tracking of source of abstracted information), (2) transmits the HTML to the data abstraction system, and (3) displays the HTML in an area adjacent to the data abstraction form in the data abstraction system. The data abstractor can mark locations on the HTML that DAA associates with items on the data abstraction form. Experiences of early users of DAA When we surveyed 52 early users of DAA, 83% reported that using DAA was either very or somewhat easy; 71% are very or somewhat likely to use DAA in the future; and 87% are very or somewhat likely to recommend that others use DAA in the future. Discussion DAA, a user-friendly software for linking abstracted data with their exact source, is likely to be a very useful tool in the toolbox of systematic reviewers.

Because of the differences in the trial designs and potential biases notably associated with the crossover trials, one often combines trials of the same designs only, which decreases the power of the meta-analysis. To combine results of clinical trials from parallel and cross-over designs, we extend the method proposed in an accompanying study to account for random effects. We propose here a hierarchical mixed model allowing the combination of the 2 types of trial designs and accounting for additional covariates where random effects can be introduced to account for heterogeneity in trial, treatment effect, and interactions. We introduce a multilevel model and a Bayesian hierarchical model for combined trial design meta-analysis. The analysis of the models by restricted iterative generalised least square and Monte Carlo Markov Chain is presented. Methods are compared in a combined design meta-analysis model on salt reduction. Both models and their respective advantages in the perspective of meta-analysis are discussed.

Recently, several meta-analyses of prognostic studies have been reported, but these studies simply combined hazard ratios provided by the individual studies, overlooking the fact that the cutoff values are study-specific. We propose a method to summarize hazard ratios with study-specific cutoff values by estimating the hazard ratio for a 1-unit change of the biomarker in the underlying individual-level model. To this end, we introduce a model for a relationship between a reported log-hazard ratio for a 1-unit expected difference in the mean biomarker value between the low-expression and high-expression groups, which approximates the individual-level model, and propose to make an inference of the model by using the method for trend estimation based on grouped exposure data. Our combined estimator provides a valid interpretation if the biomarker distribution is correctly specified. We applied our proposed method to a dataset that examined the association between the biomarker Ki-67 and disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. We conducted simulation studies to examine the performance of our method.

With individual trials typically underpowered, systematic reviews and meta-analysis are desired to assess the totality of evidence. A high percentage of zero or missing outcomes often complicate such efforts. We use a systematic review of pediatric phase I oncology trials as an example and illustrate the utility of advanced Bayesian analysis. Standard random-effects methods rely on the exchangeability of individual trial effects, typically assuming that a common normal distribution sufficiently describes random variation among the trial level effects. Summary statistics of individual trial data may become undefined with zero counts, and this assumption may not be readily examined. We conduct Bayesian semi-parametric analysis with a Dirichlet process prior and examine the assumption. The Bayesian semi-parametric analysis is also useful for visually summarizing individual trial data. It provides alternative statistics that are computed free of distributional assumptions about the shape of the population of trial level effects. Outcomes are rarely entirely missing in clinical trials. We utilize available information and conduct Bayesian incomplete data analysis. The advanced Bayesian analyses, although illustrated with the specific example, are generally applicable. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods: The algorithms were trained and validated with 8050 database records, which had previously been manually categorized as empirical or nonempirical. A Boolean mixed filter developed for filtering MEDLINE records (title, abstract, keywords, and full texts) was used as a baseline. The set of features (eg, characteristics from the data) included observable terms and concepts extracted from a metathesaurus. The efficiency of the approaches was measured using sensitivity, precision, specificity, and accuracy. Results: The decision trees algorithm demonstrated the highest performance, surpassing the accuracy of the Boolean mixed filter by 30%. The use of full texts did not result in significant gains compared with title, abstract, keywords, and records. Results also showed that mixing concepts with observable terms can improve the classification. Significance: Screening of records, identified in bibliographic databases, for relevant studies to include in systematic reviews can be accelerated with automated text classification.";"[Langlois, Alexis; Nie, Jian-Yun] Univ Montreal, Dept Informat & Rech Operat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Thomas, James] UCL, Inst Educ, EPPI Ctr, London, England; [Hong, Quan Nha; Pluye, Pierre] McGill Univ, Family Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada";"Langlois, A (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Informat & Rech Operat, DIRO, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.";"alexis.langlois@umontreal.ca";"Hong, Quan Nha/J-9737-2019";"Hong, Quan Nha/0000-0002-2576-5750; Thomas, James/0000-0003-4805-4190";"Quebec SPOR SUPPORT Unit";"We would like to thank Reem El Sherif, Genevieve Gore, and Vera Granikov for providing the data used by the Boolean mixed filter and for their valuable input.

We used framework synthesis, grounded theory and cross-case analysis methods to analyse 85 systematic reviews addressing intervention effectiveness in workplace health promotion. Two core categories, or 'modes of reasoning', emerged to frame the contrast between narrative synthesis and meta-analysis: practical-configurational reasoning in narrative synthesis ('what is going on here? What picture emerges?') and inferential-predictive reasoning in meta-analysis ('does it work, and how well? Will it work again?'). Modes of reasoning examined quality and consistency of the included evidence differently. Meta-analyses clearly distinguished between warrant and claim, whereas narrative syntheses often presented joint warrant-claims. Narrative syntheses and meta-analyses represent different modes of reasoning. Systematic reviewers are likely to be addressing research questions in different ways with each method. It is important to consider narrative synthesis in its own right as a method and to develop specific quality criteria and understandings of how it is carried out, not merely as a complement to, or second-best option for, meta-analysis.

When only dichotomous measurements are available for one of the two variables, the biserial correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the product-moment correlation between the two underlying continuous variables. Unlike the point-biserial correlation coefficient, biserial correlation coefficients can therefore be integrated with product-moment correlation coefficients in the same meta-analysis. The present article describes the estimation of the biserial correlation coefficient for meta-analytic purposes and reports simulation results comparing different methods for estimating the coefficient's sampling variance. The findings indicate that commonly employed methods yield inconsistent estimates of the sampling variance across a broad range of research situations. In contrast, consistent estimates can be obtained using two methods that appear to be unknown in the meta-analytic literature. A variance-stabilizing transformation for the biserial correlation coefficient is described that allows for the construction of confidence intervals for individual coefficients with close to nominal coverage probabilities in most of the examined conditions.

Searching for unpublished studies may avoid bias due to selective publication, enrich the power of systematic reviews, and thereby help to reduce research waste. We assessed searching practices among recent systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy. Methods We extracted data from 100 non-Cochrane systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy indexed in MEDLINE and published between October 2017 and January 2018 and from all 100 Cochrane systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy published by December 2018, irrespective of whether meta-analysis had been performed. Results Non-Cochrane and Cochrane reviews searched a median of 4 (IQR 3-5) and 6 (IQR 5-9) databases, respectively; most often MEDLINE/PubMed (n = 100 and n = 100) and EMBASE (n = 81 and n = 100). Additional efforts to identify studies beyond searching bibliographic databases were performed in 76 and 98 reviews, most often through screening reference lists (n = 71 and n = 96), review/guideline articles (n = 18 and n = 52), or citing articles (n = 3 and n = 42). Specific sources of unpublished studies were searched in 22 and 68 reviews, for example, conference proceedings (n = 4 and n = 18), databases only containing conference abstracts (n = 2 and n = 33), or trial registries (n = 12 and n = 39). At least one unpublished study was included in 17 and 23 reviews. Overall, 39 of 2082 studies (1.9%) included in non-Cochrane reviews were unpublished, and 64 of 2780 studies (2.3%) in Cochrane reviews, most often conference abstracts (97/103). Conclusion Searching practices vary considerably across systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy. Unpublished studies are a minimal fraction of the evidence included in recent reviews.";"[Korevaar, Daniel A.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Dept Resp Med, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Salameh, Jean-Paul; McInnes, Matthew D.

The MVMA model is potentially more difficult and time-consuming to apply than univariate models, so if its use makes little difference to parameter estimates, it could be argued that it is redundant. Methods We assessed the applicability and impact of MVMA in Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPCB) systematic reviews. We applied MVMA to CPCB reviews published between 2011 and 2013 with two or more binary outcomes with at least three studies and compared findings with results of univariate meta-analyses. Univariate random effects meta-analysis models were fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML). Results Eighty CPCB reviews were published. MVMA could not be applied in 70 of these reviews. MVMA was not feasible in three of the remaining 10 reviews because the appropriate models failed to converge. Estimates from MVMA agreed with those of univariate analyses in most of the other seven reviews. Statistical significance changed in two reviews: In one, this was due to a very small change in P value; in the other, the MVMA result for one outcome suggested that previous univariate results may be vulnerable to small-study effects and that the certainty of clinical conclusions needs consideration. Conclusions MVMA methods can be applied only in a minority of reviews of interventions in pregnancy and childbirth and can be difficult to apply because of missing correlations or lack of convergence. Nevertheless, clinical and/or statistical conclusions from MVMA may occasionally differ from those from univariate analyses.";"[Price, Malcolm J.; Kenyon, Sara; Deeks, Jonathan J.] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Price, Malcolm J.; Deeks, Jonathan J.] Univ Hosp Birmingham NHS Fdn Trust, N1HR Birmingham Biomed Res Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Price, Malcolm J.; Deeks, Jonathan J.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Blake, Helen A.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London, England; [Blake, Helen A.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [White, Ian R.] UCL, Clin Trials Unit, MRC, London, England; [Jackson, Dan] AstraZeneca, Stat Innovat Grp, Cambridge, England; [Kirkham, Jamie J.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Neilson, James P.] Univ Liverpool, Ctr Womens Hlth Res, Cochrane Pregnancy & Childbirth Grp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Riley, Richard D.] Keele Univ, Ctr Prognosis Res, Res Inst Primary Care & Hlth Sci, Keele, Staffs, England";"Price, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.";"m.price.2@bham.ac.uk";"Kirkham, Jamie John/AAD-4490-2019; Deeks, Jon/AAV-5745-2020";"Kirkham, Jamie John/0000-0003-2579-9325; Deeks, Jon/0000-0002-8850-1971; Kenyon, Sara/0000-0002-0756-9617";"Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/J013595/1, MC_UU_12023/21]; NIHR CLAHRC West Midlands+";"Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: MR/J013595/1, MC_UU_12023/21; NIHR CLAHRC West Midlands+";NA;36;1;1;0;3;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

Understanding, retention, and recall can be enhanced by visual presentation of information. The aim of this exploratory research was to develop and evaluate the accessibility and acceptability of visual summaries for presenting evidence syntheses with multiple exposures or outcomes to professional and lay audiences. Methods: Evidence flowers were developed as a visual method of presenting data from 4 case scenarios: 2 complex evidence syntheses with multiple outcomes, Cochrane reviews, and clinical guidelines. Petals of evidence flowers were coloured according to the GRADE evidence rating system to display key findings and recommendations from the evidence summaries. Application of evidence flowers was observed during stakeholder workshops. Evaluation and feedback were conducted via questionnaires and informal interviews. Results: Feedback from stakeholders on the evidence flowers collected from workshops, questionnaires, and interviews was encouraging and helpful for refining the design of the flowers. Comments were made on the content and design of the flowers, as well as the usability and potential for displaying different types of evidence. Conclusions: Evidence flowers are a novel and visually stimulating method for presenting research evidence from evidence syntheses with multiple exposures or outcomes, Cochrane reviews, and clinical guidelines. To promote access and engagement with research evidence, evidence flowers may be used in conjunction with other evidence synthesis products, such as (lay) summaries, evidence inventories, rapid reviews, and clinical guidelines. Additional research on potential adaptations and applications of the evidence flowers may further bridge the gap between research evidence and clinical practice.";"[Babatunde, O.

Workpackage 4 of GetReal develops evidence synthesis and modelling approaches to generate the real-world evidence. In this commentary, we discuss how questions change when moving from the well-controlled randomized trial setting to real-life medical practice, the evidence required to answer these questions, the populations to which estimates will be applicable to and the methods and data sources used to produce these estimates. We then introduce the methodological reviews written by GetReal authors and published in Research Synthesis Methods on network meta-analysis, individual patient data meta-analysis and mathematical modelling to predict drug effectiveness. The critical reviews of key methods are a good starting point for the ambitious programme of work GetReal has embarked on. The different strands of work under way in GetReal have great potential to contribute to making clinical trials research as relevant as it can be to patients, caregivers and policy makers.

In case of network meta-analysis of binary data, however, simulations are not currently available for many practically relevant settings. We perform a simulation study for sparse networks of trials under between-trial heterogeneity and including multi-arm trials. Results of the evaluation of two popular frequentist methods and a Bayesian approach using two different prior specifications are presented. Methods are evaluated using coverage, width of intervals, bias, and root mean squared error (RMSE). In addition, deviations from the theoretical surface under the cumulative rankings (SUCRAs) or P-scores of the treatments are evaluated. Under low heterogeneity and when a large number of trials informs the contrasts, all methods perform well with respect to the evaluated performance measures. Coverage is observed to be generally higher for the Bayesian than the frequentist methods. The width of credible intervals is larger than those of confidence intervals and is increasing when using a flatter prior for between-trial heterogeneity. Bias was generally small, but increased with heterogeneity, especially in netmeta. In some scenarios, the direction of bias differed between frequentist and Bayesian methods. The RMSE was comparable between methods but larger in indirectly than in directly estimated treatment effects. The deviation of the SUCRAs or P-scores from their theoretical values was mostly comparable over the methods but differed depending on the heterogeneity and the geometry of the investigated network. Multivariate meta-regression or Bayesian estimation using a half-normal prior scaled to 0.5 seems to be promising with respect to the evaluated performance measures in network meta-analysis of sparse networks.";"[Seide, Svenja E.; Jensen, Katrin; Kieser, Meinhard] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, Neuenheimer Feld 130-3, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany";"Seide, SE (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, Neuenheimer Feld 130-3, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.";"seide@imbi.uni-heidelberg.de";NA;"Jensen, Katrin/0000-0002-5088-5279; Seide, Svenja/0000-0002-9113-7373";NA;NA;NA;53;3;3;0;2;"WILEY";"HOBOKEN";"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA";"1759-2879";"1759-2887";NA;"RES SYNTH METHODS";"Res.

A systematic search of five databases was complemented with citation tracking, hand searches, and expert consultation. We included 13 experimental and quasi-experimental intervention studies. Methodological quality and quality-of-intervention descriptions were assessed. Analysis of empirical support for expected intervention effects indicated that, under certain conditions, literature education may foster students' insight into human nature. One intervention affected students' insight into themselves, two affected their understanding of fictional others, and six affected their understanding of, views on, or intended behavior toward real-world others. Subsequent analysis of interventions with full or partial empirical support yielded instructional design principles on (a) text selection; (b) activating, annotating, and reflecting on personal life and reading experiences in writing activities; and (c) verbally sharing these experiences with others in exploratory dialogues.

In this review we analyzed literature published between 2000 and 2015 on mathematics teaching and learning with K-12 ELs. We identified 75 peer-reviewed, empirical studies related to the teaching and learning of mathematics with ELs in Grades K-12 and categorized the studies by focus (Learning, Teaching, and Teacher Education).

Results of our random-effects metaregression model indicate a significant, moderate relation between motivation and reading, r = .22, p < .001. Moderation analyses revealed that the motivation construct being measured influenced the relation between motivation and reading. There were no other significant moderating or interaction effects related to reading domain, sample type, or grade level. Evidence to support the bidirectional nature of the relation between motivation and reading was provided through longitudinal analyses, with findings suggesting that earlier reading is a stronger predictor of later motivation than motivation is of reading.

A meta-analysis of 131 studies with 478 effect sizes was conducted. The results indicated that a significant negative correlation exist between MA and mathematics performance, r = -.34. Moderation analyses indicated that dimensions of MA, difficulty of mathematical tasks, and effects on student grades differentially affected the relation between MA and mathematics performance. MA assessed with both cognitive and affective dimensions showed a stronger negative correlation with mathematics performance compared to MA assessed with either an affective dimension only or mixed/unspecified dimensions. Advanced mathematical tasks that require multistep processes showed a stronger negative correlation to MA compared to foundational mathematical tasks. Mathematics measures that affected/reflected student grades (e.g., final exam, students' course grade, GPA) had a stronger negative correlation to MA than did other measures of mathematics performance that did not affect student grades (e.g., mathematics measures administered as part of research).

Most teachers respond by differentiating their instruction to some extent, but not all scholars and educators agree on whether differentiated instruction works. This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to determine the effects of Tier 1 differentiation, which is provided by the general education classroom teacher, on literacy outcomes. Distinguishing between designed differentiation and interactional differentiation, the authors provide multiple examples of content, process, and product differentiation in the context of literacy instruction. Reviewing more than 20 years of literacy research, the authors located 18 studies with 25 study cohorts. Outcomes include fluency, decoding, letter-word reading, vocabulary, comprehension, and writing achievement. The overall weighted mean effect size (g) was +0.13 (p = .002) with 88% of the individual point estimates being positive. Overall, the findings indicate that differentiated literacy instruction is an effective evidence-based practice at the elementary level. When teachers are supported to differentiate instruction, students have significantly higher literacy achievement scores, particularly for letter-word (g = +0.20, p = .014) and writing outcomes (g = +0.96, p < .001). The most successful programs took very different approaches to differentiation, including individualization, choice, and an alternate curriculum. However, across the studies, there was an alarming lack of information about the decision-making processes used to guide differentiation and there were no experimental or quasi-experimental studies on guided reading. This review may be helpful as schools clarify their vision for literacy differentiation.";"[Puzio, Kelly] SquidBooks, Spokane, WA 99203 USA; [Puzio, Kelly; Algeo-Nichols, Dana] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Colby, Glenn T.] Amer Assoc Univ Prof, Washington, DC USA";"Puzio, K (corresponding author), SquidBooks, Spokane, WA 99203 USA.; Puzio, K (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;92;0;0;3;3;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Research demonstrates that students who take practice tests often outperform students in nontesting learning conditions such as restudying, practice, filler activities, or no presentation of the material. However, evidence-based meta-analysis is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which practice tests enhance or inhibit learning. This meta-analysis fills this gap by examining the effects of practice tests versus nontesting learning conditions. Results reveal that practice tests are more beneficial for learning than restudying and all other comparison conditions. Mean effect sizes were moderated by the features of practice tests, participant and study characteristics, outcome constructs, and methodological features of the studies. Findings may guide the use of practice tests to advance student learning, and inform students, teachers, researchers, and policymakers.

The current study systematically reviews and synthesizes evidence on the association between teacher-student interactions and EFs. The search resulted in 28 studies, from which 23 studies provided sufficient data to be included in the calculations. Overall effect sizes indicate that teacher-child interactions are related to general executive functioning, working memory, and inhibition but not cognitive flexibility. Relationships were stronger for studies including children at the beginning of elementary school, studies with higher socioeconomic status participants and more boys, and studies measuring teacher-child interactions at the dyadic level. This study shows that qualitative teacher-child interactions are important for performance in EFs in children. This suggests that teachers can promote the cognitive processes that are essential in children's learning by changing their behavior to create an emotionally positive, structured, and cognitively stimulating classroom environment.";"[Vandenbroucke, Loren; Piccinin, Claire; Baeyens, Dieter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Unit Parenting & Special Educ, Leuven, Belgium; [Spilt, Jantine; Verschueren, Karine] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Psychol & Child & Adolescent Dev, Res Unit, Leuven, Belgium";"Vandenbroucke, L (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Unit Parenting & Special Educ, Leuven, Belgium.";"loren.vandenbroucke@kuleuven.be; jantine.spilt@kuleuven.be; karine.verschueren@kuleuven.be; claire.piccinin@student.kuleuven.be; dieter.baeyens@kuleuven.be";NA;"Baeyens, Dieter/0000-0002-3875-687X; Verschueren, Karine/0000-0003-2172-1424; Spilt, Jantine/0000-0002-3863-9868";NA;NA;NA;122;16;16;9;94;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

We found the majority of the literature we reviewed conceptualized them as learners based on their academic performance and the influence of cultures on their learning. These two conceptualizations positioned first-generation college students against normative ways of learning, and in doing so promulgate an assimilation approach in higher education. We found a smaller body of literature that conceptualized first-generation college students as learners whose lived experiences, when connected to academic content, can contribute to their academic learning, advancement of disciplines, self-growth, and community development.

For universal SEL interventions delivered to all students, a random-effects model with 33 primary studies showed small to medium effects for the overall development of social and emotional skills (Hedges's g = .34) and for the reduction of problem behaviors (g = .32), with an overall grand mean of g = .35. For targeted interventions, delivered to at-risk students identified as being in need of additional supports, a random-effects model with 15 primary studies showed medium effects for the overall development of social and emotional skills (Hedges's g = .44) and for the reduction of problem behaviors (g = .50), with an overall grand mean of g = .48. A meta-regression model showed that intervention program accounted for 83% of heterogeneity in the overall effect size for universal interventions. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrated that preschool children benefit from SEL interventions in different contexts, particularly those who were identified as being in need of early intervention. Moreover, best practices for preschool SEL interventions may differ from best practices for K-12 students, given the developmental uniqueness of the preschool years.";"[Murano, Dana] ACT Inc, Ctr Social Emot & Acad Learning, 500 ACT Dr, Iowa City, IA 52243 USA; [Sawyer, Jeremy E.] CUNY, Kingsborough Community Coll, Psychol, 2001 Oriental Blvd, Brooklyn, NY 11235 USA; [Lipnevich, Anastasiya A.] CUNY Queens Coll, Educ Psychol, 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Lipnevich, Anastasiya A.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA";"Murano, D (corresponding author), ACT Inc, Ctr Social Emot & Acad Learning, 500 ACT Dr, Iowa City, IA 52243 USA.";"dana.murano@act.org; jeremy.ek.sawyer@gmail.com; anastasiya.lipnevich@qc.cuny.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;123;0;0;27;27;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Although both Black male and female students experience constrained opportunities to learn, the popular and academic conversation has almost unilaterally focused on the plight of Black boys and men. Drawing on critical race theory, this meta-ethnographic literature review synthesizes what is currently known about the advantages and obstacles young Black women encounter within public schooling contexts given their marginalized racial and gender identities. The data were drawn from a careful systematic search of electronic databases, key journals, books, and the reference lists of key articles, which yielded 37 sources for review. The analysis revealed that school officials positioned young Black women to be undisciplined in their academic habits and unequivocally misaligned with school norms. As such, they were viewed as unapproachable, unteachable, and ultimately fully responsible for the limited academic opportunities they experienced. On the other hand, young Black women spoke of themselves as highly ambitious and driven learners. They felt unfairly handicapped in their pursuit of educational and occupational success at the hands of school officials who misconstrued their identities, and given institutional policies that targeted them and failed to meet their needs. The review discusses implications of these varied perspectives in viewing the school experiences of young Black women and offers future directions for study and practice.";"[Neal-Jackson, Alaina] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Educ Fdn & Policy, 610 East Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";"Neal-Jackson, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Educ Fdn & Policy, 610 East Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.";"alainamn@umich.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;72;9;9;2;17;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Based on our literature review, we identify current gaps in the research, including a lack of solid frameworks to explain learning in open online setting. Finally, we put forward a novel framework suitable for open online contexts based on a well-established model of student engagement. Our model is intended to guide future work studying the association between contextual factors (i.e., demographic, classroom, and individual needs), student engagement (i.e., academic, behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement metrics), and learning outcomes (i.e., academic, social, and affective).

Therefore, this study reviews the literature on community schools. First, we characterize community schools and find that their key activities are cooperating with other institutions, involving parents, and offering extracurricular activities. Second, we describe an exemplary community school for which causal evidence shows improved academic achievement. Third, we explore whether the three main activities of community schools influence academic performance, dropout, and risky behavior. Academic performance does not appear to be influenced by extracurricular activities. On the other hand, extracurricular activities do appear to be related to reduced dropout and risky behavior. In addition, there is a positive association of cooperation and parental involvement with academic achievement, and a negative correlation of these two factors with dropout and risky behavior.

Each study was examined and coded in terms of study characteristics, strength of evidence, and quality of evidence. The interventions represented in the studies were grouped into four categories: social-emotional learning, behavioral, coping skills, and other. The studies of behavioral interventions demonstrated the strongest effects on increasing prosocial behavior and decreasing antisocial behavior. These studies also included the highest quality of research. The social-emotional learning intervention studies consistently demonstrated weaker effects and lower quality research. The remaining categories included too few studies to draw meaningful conclusions.

The median effect of intelligent tutoring in the 50 evaluations was to raise test scores 0.66 standard deviations over conventional levels, or from the 50th to the 75th percentile. However, the amount of improvement found in an evaluation depended to a great extent on whether improvement was measured on locally developed or standardized tests, suggesting that alignment of test and instructional objectives is a critical determinant of evaluation results. The review also describes findings from two groups of evaluations that did not meet all of the selection requirements for the meta-analysis: six evaluations with nonconventional control groups and four with flawed implementations of intelligent tutoring systems.

Based on this premise, the first aim of this article is to provide a theoretical integration through the development of a framework based on the principles of complex dynamic systems theory, which describes and explains children's creativity. This model is used to explain differing views on the role of education in developing children's creativity. Our second aim is empirical integration. On the basis of a three-dimensional taxonomy, we performed a systematic review of the recent literature (2006-2017, 184 studies) on primary school students' creativity. Our results show that creativity is most often measured as a static, aggregated construct. In line with our theoretical model, we suggest ways that future research can elaborate on the moment-to-moment interactions that form the basis of long-term creative development, as well as on the mechanisms that connect different levels of creativity.";"[Kupers, Elisa] Univ Groningen, Dept Special Educ Needs & Youth Care, Grote Rozenstr 38, NL-9712 TJ Groningen, Netherlands; [Lehmann-Wermser, Andreas] Hsch Mus Theater & Medien Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [McPherson, Gary] Univ Melbourne, Fac VCA & MCM, Gate 12, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [van Geert, Paul] Univ Groningen, Dept Dev Psychol, Grote Kruisstr 2-1, NL-9712 TS Groningen, Netherlands";"Kupers, E (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Special Educ Needs & Youth Care, Grote Rozenstr 38, NL-9712 TJ Groningen, Netherlands.";"w.e.kupers@rug.nl; andreas.lehmann-wermser@hmtm-hannover.de; g.mcpherson@unimelb.edu.au; p.l.c.van.geert@rug.nl";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;112;7;7;7;67;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

We ask several questions. How did this subfield emerge and what are the key conceptual frameworks that shape it today? How do education in emergencies programs affect access, learning, and protection in conflict-affected contexts? To answer these questions, we identify the conceptual frameworks and theoretical advances that have occurred since the inception of the field in the mid-1990s. We review the theories that frame the relationship between education and conflict as well as empirical research that tests assumptions that underpin this relationship. Finally, we assess what we know to date about what works in education in emergencies based on intervention research. We find that with regard to access, diminished or inequitable access to education drives conflict; conflict reduces boys' and girls' access to education differently; and decreased distance to primary school increases enrollment and attendance significantly for boys and even more so for girls. With regard to learning, education content likely contributes to or mitigates conflict, although the mechanisms through which it does so remain underspecified;and peace education programs show promise in changing attitudes and behaviors toward members of those perceived as the other, at least in the short term. Finally, providing children living in emergency and postemergency situations with structured, meaningful, and creative activities in a school setting or in informal learning spaces improves their emotional and behavioral well-being.";"[Burde, Dana; Guven, Ozen] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Int Educ, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Burde, Dana] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Dept Polit, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Kapit, Amy] Global Coalit Protect Educ Attack, New York, NY USA; [Wahl, Rachel L.] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Dept Leadership Fdn & Policy, 405 Emmet St S, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Skarpeteig, Margot Igland] Mission Norway United Nations, Rome, Italy";"Burde, D (corresponding author), NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Int Educ, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA.; Burde, D (corresponding author), NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Dept Polit, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA.";"dana.burde@nyu.edu; ark332@nyu.edu; rlw4ck@virginia.edu; ozen.guven@nyu.edu; mts@norad.no";"Guven, Ozen/AAK-5261-2020";NA;"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation";"The first wave of research for this article was carried out with the generous support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (https://www.norad.no/en/front/).";NA;153;14;14;4;41;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Nonetheless, scientific evidence establishing directional links and mechanisms between SES, school climate, and academic performance is inconclusive. This comprehensive review of studies dating back to the year 2000 examined whether a positive climate can successfully disrupt the associations between low SES and poor academic achievement. Positive climate was found to mitigate the negative contribution of weak SES background on academic achievement; however, most studies do not provide a basis for deducing a directional influence and causal relations.

The purpose of this project was to conduct a systematic review of these studies because the primary studies often yielded divergent results. Included studies entailed an intervention, addressed reading specifically, and reported explicit pre- and postintervention measures of reading self-efficacy. Subjects were students in elementary grades through college. The results of a systematic search and screening procedure found 30 studies in which 2,300 subjects received treatments of various kinds while 1,957 were in control or comparison groups. A meta-analysis of three subsets of study designs revealed that each subset generated a significant effect size: treatment-control (g = 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.10, 0.39]); treatment-comparison (g = 0.44, 95% CI [0.04, 0.84]); pretest-posttest (g = 0.36, 95% CI [0.16, 0.57]). Significant heterogeneity was found and modeled using moderator analyses conducted on several variables. The results indicated that significant moderators of effect sizes included grade level, number of sources shaping reading self-efficacy, a reading self-efficacy measurement index, and journal publication. In studies that measured the impact of the intervention on reading comprehension, its relationship with reading self-efficacy was analyzed revealing a strong correlation between the two constructs. Discussion includes an exploration of the importance of these findings to future policy, practice, and research on the design of reading self-efficacy measurement instruments and on interventions that utilize major sources of experiences shaping reading self-efficacy.";"[Unrau, Norman J.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, 1604 Manzanita Lane, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 USA; [Rueda, Robert] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Educ Psychol, 1440 El Travesia Dr, La Habra Hts, CA 90631 USA; [Son, Elena] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea; [Polanin, Joshua R.] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Lundeen, Rebecca J.; Muraszewski, Alison K.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Waite Phillips Hall,3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA";"Unrau, NJ (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, 1604 Manzanita Lane, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 USA.";"nunrau@calstatela.edu; rueda@usc.edu; eson@usc.edu; jpolanin@air.org; rebecca.lundeen@gmail.com; alisonkeller4@yahoo.com";"Polanin, Joshua/M-8800-2019";"Polanin, Joshua/0000-0001-5100-0164";NA;NA;NA;53;6;6;3;26;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Though more current research has used a diverse array of designs and methodologies to examine impact on teacher knowledge, practice, and student learning, uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of various PD models remains, particularly for these nonperceptive variables. There has been a call in the field to apply a consistent conceptual framework in order to identify critical mechanisms underlying effective models and to support improved theorizing about teaching and learning. Thus, we present an integrated literature synthesis of one collaborative model of PD, teacher study groups (TSGs), in an effort to make sense of the relatively rich body of research that has been performed on this model. We identified 32 studies that examined TSGs' impact on teacher and student outcomes and synthesized this research using Desimone's five-factor conceptual framework, which is being increasingly applied across the field. Findings suggest that TSGs are an effective PD model and that there are components of the model not accounted for in the five-factor framework that affect teacher outcomes and student learning. We conclude with a discussion of implications, including limitations of the five-factor framework and ideas for further refinement that situate PD in a vast empirical landscape.";"[Firestone, Allison R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, 2121 Berkeley Way,4th Floor, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cruz, Rebecca A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rodl, Janelle E.] San Francisco State Univ, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA";"Firestone, AR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, 2121 Berkeley Way,4th Floor, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.";"allisonfirestone@berkeley.edu; rebecca.cruz01@sjsu.edu; jrodl@sfsu.edu";"Cruz, Rebecca/AAX-9629-2020";"Cruz, Rebecca/0000-0002-9163-1312; Firestone, Allison R./0000-0003-0290-1788";NA;NA;NA;88;0;0;8;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

The extent to which the experimental intervention studies are culturally responsive remains unexplored. We developed a rubric, modeled after prior rubrics for quality indicators of special education research, identifying criteria for culturally responsive research. Rubric items were created following a systematic review of literature and gathering feedback from experts. The 15-item rubric uses culture as a generative concept that mediates each aspect of experimental intervention research.

Despite being recognized by the federal government since 1992, HSIs lack a historical mission to serve Latinxs. As such the idea of servingness has become an elusive concept. An abundance of literature centering HSIs has been published, yet there continues to be a debate about what it means to serve students. We conducted a systematic review of 148 journal articles and book chapters to better understand how researchers conceptualize the idea of servingness at HSIs. We identified four major themes used by researchers to conceptualize servingness: (1) outcomes, (2) experiences, (3) internal organizational dimensions, and (4) external influences. We also found that researchers are often unintentional in their efforts to conceptualize what it means to be an HSI.

The review sought to document the size, growth trajectory, and geographic distribution of EA research, identify high impact scholars and documents, and illuminate the intellectual structure of the field. Although science mapping has been applied widely in science, medicine, and social sciences, it is still new in the field of education. The authors identified 22,361 peer-reviewed articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed EA journals between 1960 and 2018. The authors used VOSviewer, Excel, and Tableau software to analyze the data set. The review found that the EA knowledge base has grown dramatically since 1960 with an accelerating rate growth and increasing gender and geographic diversity during the past two decades. Using co-citation analysis, the review identified canonical documents, defined as highly influential documents whose impact has been sustained for a period of several decades. The review also identified four key Schools of Thought that have emerged over time focusing on Leadership for Learning, Leadership and Cultural Change, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, and Leading Teachers. More broadly, our findings highlighted a paradigm shift from school administration to school leadership over the course of the six decades. Another significant finding identified leadership for student learning and development as the cognitive anchor of the intellectual structure of the EA knowledge base.

To address this gap, this study used Bayesian network meta-analysis to synthesize within-subjects (pre-post) differences resulting from scaffolding in 56 studies. We generated the posterior distribution using 20,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples.

Our findings indicate that the causes of the disparities are numerous and multifaceted. Although low-income and minority students experience suspensions and expulsions at higher rates than their peers, these differences cannot be solely attributed to socioeconomic status or increased misbehavior. Instead, school and classroom occurrences that result from the policies, practices, and perspectives of teachers and principals appear to play an important role in explaining the disparities.

The present review aims to inform educators on what cognitive neuroscience can teach us about self-regulation. To do so, we will focus on a decade-long research program examining children with disruptive behavior problems and their peers, and ask whether neural measures of self-regulation can (a) covary with individual differences in behavioral measures of self-regulation, (b) trace developmental patterns, and (c) predict or trace behavioral change with successful treatment of disruptive behavior problems.

It is imperative, therefore, that educational researchers and school-based professionals address the needs of students who exhibit maladaptive behavior to alter their poor outcome trajectory. Social problem-solving (SPS) instruction is a promising approach for improving social competence and changing problem behaviors. Despite documented outcomes for SPS instruction in school settings, Coleman, Wheeler, and Webber's review appears to be the most up-to-date compilation of the SPS literature. Thus, the purpose of this article is to present a more current review of the literature on SPS interventions in school settings.

The present meta-analysis, which included 48 peer-reviewed journal articles and doctoral dissertations written over a 16-year period (2000-2015) involving 5,294 participants, revealed that mCSCL has produced meaningful improvements for collaborative learning, with an overall mean effect size of 0.516. Moderator variables, such as domain subject, group size, teaching method, intervention duration, and reward method were related to different effect sizes.

This article provides the first systematic review of the existing quantitative literature on education and political violence. Looking at arguments pertaining to levels, expansion, inequality, and content of education, we identify 42 quantitative studies from the time period 1996 to 2016 that test the relationship between various measures of education and political violence. An emerging scholarly consensus seems to be that education has a general pacifying effect. However, this general conclusion is challenged by recent evidence showing above-average levels of education among terrorists and genocide perpetrators. This, as well as other findings, underscore that the relationship between education and political violence is complex and multidimensional, depending on type of political violence, mediating factors, and level of analysis.

After a systematic literature search, I conducted a meta-analysis synthesizing 56 articles containing 66 separate experiments and quasi-experiments and 83 treatment arms. I evaluated 12 types of education interventions such as the provision of school supplies, the use of teacher incentives, and school-based management programs. I examine each intervention type, present analytics on relative effectiveness, and explore why certain interventions seem to be more effective. A key finding is that programs that alter teacher pedagogy or classroom instructional techniques had an effect size approximately 0.30 standard deviations greater than all other types of programs combined. Limited evidence further suggests that pedagogical programs that employed adaptive instruction or teacher coaching were particularly effective. Given that the literature in the field is still nascent overall, these results advocate for further research into these pedagogical interventions.";"[Conn, Katharine M.] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Consortium Policy Res Educ, 525 West 120th St,Box 124, New York, NY 10027 USA";"Conn, KM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Consortium Policy Res Educ, 525 West 120th St,Box 124, New York, NY 10027 USA.";"kmc2169@tc.columbia.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;107;25;25;3;23;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

The 81 reviewed studies reveal that undocumented students confront significant financial barriers, shoulder unique psychological and social burdens tied to their legal status, and lack access to forms of social capital that facilitate postsecondary success. At the same time, they bring a host of assets to college campuses-including civic engagement and resilience-that are underutilized. Although their experiences are dependent on ethnoracial group and geographic context, these differences have not been sufficiently studied. Likewise, researchers have not adequately explored the impact of institutional, state, and federal programs designed to help undocumented students.

Seventy-five cognitive profiling studies on MD were included, representing a total of 13,001 individuals and 126 independent samples. Results showed that compared with typically developing individuals, individuals with MD showed deficits (from most severe to less severe) in phonological processing, processing speed, working memory, attention, short-term memory, executive functions, and visuospatial skills. Moderation analyses indicated that comorbidity (with reading disabilities) and types of MD screening affected the cognitive deficits. Severity of MD was related to processing speed deficits. Deficits in phonological processing and attention were more severe in younger individuals with MD. Deficits in processing speed and working memory were most severe in the numerical domain. Deficits in low-level cognitive skills (i.e., processing speed and short-term memory) could not completely explain the deficits in high-level skills (i.e., working memory, attention, and executive functions), partially supporting the bottleneck theory. These findings, taken together, suggest that (a) deficits in processing speed and working memory are most salient and stable cognitive markers of MD, (b) numerical-processing deficit and the cognitive deficits of MD are relatively independent from each other, and (c) MD may be a discrete construct with heterogeneity reflected by MD subtypes and age. Implications for incorporating cognition in the diagnosis and the interventions for MD are discussed.";"[Peng, Peng; Namkung, Jessica] Univ Nebraska, Dept Special Educ & Commun Disorders, Barkley Mem Ctr 301, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Wang, Cuicui] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Peng, P (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Special Educ & Commun Disorders, Barkley Mem Ctr 301, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.";"kevpp2004@hotmail.com; 778925247@qq.com; jessica.m.namkung@gmail.com";"Peng, Peng/K-2996-2019";"Peng, Peng/0000-0003-4797-6126";NA;NA;NA;163;16;16;5;52;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Evidence indicates that the pipeline model is dominated by ideal worker norms. These norms impose rigid, tightly coupled, sequential, time-bound requirements on aspiring academics, making the raising of young children and advancing an academic career incompatible. Studies indicate that women with PhDs and young children are disproportionately more likely to leak out of the tenure-track pipeline. Lack of family friendliness is one of the chief reasons why women opt out of tenure-track careers. One way to increase the proportion of tenured women is to adapt the pipeline model by bolstering institutional work-family policies and providing child care centers. Departmental leaders can ensure that making use of work-family policies does not negatively affect tenure decisions. Collecting longitudinal data to evaluate how well policies are working is critical.";"[Ahmad, Seher] Univ Penn, Sociol & Higher Educ, 3700 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"Ahmad, S (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sociol & Higher Educ, 3700 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.";"sehera@gse.upenn.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;99;12;13;3;40;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Negative paths from achievement to noncorresponding self-concept, indicating dimensional comparison effects, were strongest when the subjects were dissimilar with regard to the math-verbal continuum, reduced but still significantly negative when both subjects belonged to the verbal domain, and near-zero when both subjects belonged to the math/science domain. Additionally, we found stronger positive paths from achievements to corresponding self-concepts, indicating social comparison effects, and stronger dimensional comparison effects for grades than for standardized test scores, and for older rather than younger students.

However, many teachers complete preparation programs feeling underprepared to work in culturally diverse classrooms, making high-quality professional development (PD) in this area crucial. We undertook a meta-ethnographic, systematic literature review of 40 studies of multicultural education-focused PD programs in order to better understand the forms and features of such programs that contribute to teachers' self-efficacy and success in working with culturally diverse students. We found a small literature base with too much variation across types of programs studied and outcomes analyzed to draw conclusions about the factors that contribute to effectiveness. However, the extant literature does point to important questions and considerations for both providers and researchers of multicultural education PD. One area for future research is how PD providers navigate tensions or challenges arising from resistance to discussions of diversity and equity. Another is locating the balance between providing specific knowledge about students' cultures and guarding against promoting stereotypes or broad generalizations. Researchers and PD developers should also pay close attention to their underlying theories related to both teacher learning and multicultural education.";"[Parkhouse, Hillary; Massaro, Virginia R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Sch Educ, 1015 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Lu, Chu Yi] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Fdn Educ, Sch Educ, 1015 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA";"Parkhouse, H (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Sch Educ, 1015 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.";"heparkhouse@vcu.edu; luqiucy@mymail.vcu.edu; massarovrr@mymail.vcu.edu";NA;"Parkhouse, Hillary/0000-0002-4785-501X; Massaro, Virginia/0000-0001-5349-4030";NA;NA;NA;95;0;0;5;30;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

Bourdieu originally developed the concept in the 1960s and 1970s by mixing French intellectual traditions with ideas from American social science. American researchers have adopted the term over three generations. The first generation understood the concept during the 1970s and early 1980s within broader traditions of mobility research, educational stratification, and conflict theory. Between the late 1980s and early 2000s, a second generation produced three variants of the concept. Over the past decade, a third generation has elaborated those variants into three distinct streams. A first stream, the DiMaggio tradition, uses survey methods to conceive cultural capital as resources that shape student outcomes. A second stream, the Lareau tradition, uses qualitative observations to interpret cultural capital as family strategies that align with schools' institutional rewards. A third stream, the Collins tradition, offers the most micro-oriented conception of cultural capital, seen as stocks of meanings that facilitate ritual interactions.

First, reducing the costs of going to school and expanding schooling options increase attendance and attainment, but do not consistently increase student achievement. Second, providing information about school quality, developmentally appropriate parenting practices, and the economic returns to schooling affects the actions of parents and the achievement of children and adolescents. Third, more or better resources improve student achievement only if they result in changes in children's daily experiences at school.

The findings corroborate the assumption that book giveaway programs promote children's home literacy environment (d = 0.31, 95% CI [0.23, 0.38], k = 30), which subsequently results in more interest in reading and children scoring higher on measures of literacy-related skills prior to and during the early years of school (d = 0.29, 95% CI [0.23, 0.35], k = 23).";"[de Bondt, Merel] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Willenberg, Ingrid A.] Australian Catholic Univ, Literacy Educ, 25A Barker Rd, Strathfield, NSW 2135, Australia; [Bus, Adriana G.] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Bus, Adriana G.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Educ, Budapest, Hungary";"de Bondt, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Language Literature & Commun, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.";"m.de.bondt@vu.nl; ingrid.willenberg@acu.edu.au; jeanetbus@gmail.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;92;0;0;8;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0034-6543";"1935-1046";NA;"REV EDUC RES";"Rev.

The specific purposes of this article are to identify and synthesize the empirical research on how leadership influences student achievement and to provide evidence on how school leaders should direct their efforts. During the literature review, we consulted experts for recommendations and searched peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2014. The literature review yielded 56 empirical research studies of relevance to the topic and 3 frameworks consisting of clustered practices.

Two exploratory moderator analyses suggest that the negative effects of placement into developmental education are stronger for university students than for community college students and worse for students placed in reading or writing than in math.

Included studies have used a treatment-control group design, were performed in OECD and EU countries, and measured achievement by standardized tests in mathematics or reading. The analysis included 101 studies performed during 2000 to 2014, 76% of which were randomized controlled trials. The effect sizes (ES) of many interventions indicate that it is possible to substantially improve educational achievement for the target group. Intervention components such as tutoring (ES = 0.36), feedback and progress monitoring (ES = 0.32), and cooperative learning (ES = 0.22) have average ES that are educationally important, statistically significant, and robust.

This meta-analysis therefore synthesized the results of 72 studies to compare the effectiveness of different types of guidance for different age categories. Results showed facilitative overall effects of guidance on learning activities (d = 0.66, 95% CI [0.44, 0.88]), performance success (d = 0.71, 95% CI [0.52, 0.90]), and learning outcomes (d = 0.50, 95% CI [0.37, 0.62]).

Children with autism spectrum disorder bring challenges to classroom teaching, often exhibiting interests restricted to particular topics. Teachers can be faced with a dilemma either to accommodate these restricted interests (RIs) into teaching or to keep them out of the classroom altogether. In this article, we examined all peer-reviewed studies of teaching children with autism spectrum disorder with RIs published between 1990 and 2014. We find that positive gains in learning and social skills can be achieved by incorporating children's RIs into classroom practice: Of 20 published studies that examined 91 children, all reported gains in educational attainment and/or social engagement. Negative consequences were limited to a decrease in task performance in one child and a transient increase in perseverative behaviors in two children. The evidence supports the inclusion of RIs into classroom practice. Methods of inclusion of RIs are discussed in light of practical difficulties and ideal outcomes.";"[Gunn, Kerry C.

Additional goals were to identify how researchers defined and measured comprehension, and the various trends that have emerged over the past 25 years, since Dillon's review. Analysis showed that relatively few researchers defined either reading or digital reading, and that the majority of studies relied on researcher-developed measures. Three types of trends were identified in this body of work: incremental (significant increase; e.g., number of studies conducted, variety of digital devices used), stationary (relative stability; e.g., research setting, chose of participants), and iterative (wide fluctuation; e.g., text length, text manipulations).

The curriculum was initially designed for superior students at exclusive private schools. Recently, however, the AP program has expanded to serve more students from marginalized backgrounds, and equitable access has become one of its core objectives. Scholars have questioned whether AP can continue to offer effective college preparation while expanding beyond the populations it was initially designed to serve. This literature review summarizes existing research on whether the AP program has achieved its dual goals of equal access and effectiveness. The extant literature suggests that, despite impressive gains in access to AP, significant barriers remain to its becoming a program that ensures equal access for all students and effectively prepares them for college coursework.

A large body of research examines these urban and rural closures from a variety of perspectives, including their economic motivations and policy implications. This review reexamines this literature, looking across context to show how school closure can produce spatial injustice. Advocates argue that closures further academic opportunity, efficiency, and equality.

We review the empirical literature on teacher coaching and conduct meta-analyses to estimate the mean effect of coaching programs on teachers' instructional practice and students' academic achievement. Combining results across 60 studies that employ causal research designs, we find pooled effect sizes of 0.49 standard deviations (SD) on instruction and 0.18 SD on achievement. Much of this evidence comes from literacy coaching programs for prekindergarten and elementary school teachers in the United States. Although these findings affirm the potential of coaching as a development tool, further analyses illustrate the challenges of taking coaching programs to scale while maintaining effectiveness. Average effects from effectiveness trials of larger programs are only a fraction of the effects found in efficacy trials of smaller programs.

ADHD diagnoses have risen among children with both severe and mild behavioral problems, partly in response to mounting academic pressure. This study examines the consequences of ADHD diagnosis. Diagnosis can bring beneficial pharmacological treatment and social supports, but it can also trigger negative social and psychological processes, as suggested by labeling theory. For children with mild behavioral problems, diagnosis may trigger awareness of being ''different'' for the first time, for example through negative teacher/peer effects. By matching diagnosed and otherwise comparable undiagnosed children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 1998-1999, I find that medication has positive effects for diagnosed children with severe prediagnosis behavioral problems, yielding comparable future teacher-rated school behaviors as undiagnosed matches. However, diagnosed and medicated children with mild prediagnosis behavioral problems exhibit poorer future teacher-rated social and academic behaviors than their undiagnosed matches, consistent with labeling theory.";"[Owens, Jayanti] Brown Univ, Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Owens, Jayanti] Brown Univ, Int & Publ Affairs, Providence, RI 02912 USA";"Owens, J (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Maxcy Hall,Box 1916, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Owens, J (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int & Publ Affairs, Maxcy Hall,Box 1916, Providence, RI 02912 USA.";"jayanti.owens@gmail.com";NA;"Owens, Jayanti/0000-0002-2859-5400";"Brown Population Studies and Training Center from the NICHD [P2CHD 041020]; Brown University; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars ProgramRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF); University of Wisconsin-Madison";"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author is grateful for support from the Brown Population Studies and Training Center, which receives funding from the NICHD (P2CHD 041020); Brown University; the National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars Program; and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.";NA;54;1;1;3;3;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

If girls develop weaker preferences for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), it can contribute to macrolevel gender inequalities in income and status. Relying on large-scale panel data on adolescents from Sweden (218 classrooms, 4,998 students), we observe a widening gender gap in preferring STEM subjects within a year (girls, 19 to 15 percent; boys, 21 to 20 percent). By applying newly developed random-coefficient multilevel stochastic actor-oriented models on social network data (27,428 friendships), we investigate how social context contributes to those changes. We find strong evidence that students adjust their preferences to those of their friends (friend influence). Moreover, girls tend to retain their STEM preferences when other girls in their classroom also like STEM (peer exposure).

Parental networks are positively related to school involvement activities in formal organizations that consist of parents, teachers, and school staff, including participating in parent-teacher organizations and volunteering at school. Furthermore, the positive effects of parental networks on parental school involvement is stronger for families whose children attend schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

I use administrative data from public elementary schools in North Carolina to calculate value-added measures of teachers' success in promoting learning, and I assess benefits for different students. Results suggest that differential benefits of effective teachers uniquely exacerbate black-white inequalities but do not contribute to economic achievement gaps. Racial differences are small, on average, relative to the benefits for all groups; are not explained by differences in prior achievement; and are largest for low-achieving students.

I argue that diffusion of global policy ideas and practices provides the menu of possible policies, while within-country struggles over legitimacy in the policy domain serve as a mechanism shaping which items on the menu becomes actual policy. Specifically, in the Israeli case, the interest in and action toward school violence were influenced by a global trend, but the actions of Psychological-Counseling Services (PCS) who struggled to assert their legitimacy as the authority on school violence in the Israeli Ministry of Education (MOE) shaped the adoption, rejection, and institutionalization of the specific school violence policy ideas and practices.";"[Fast, Idit] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Sociol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA";"Fast, I (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Sociol, 26 Nichol Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.";"ifast@sociology.rutgers.edu";NA;"Fast, Idit/0000-0002-7037-1857";NA;NA;NA;83;1;2;1;15;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Results indicated that low prior achievement, socioeconomic disadvantage, and minority status were associated with a high propensity to provide daily homework help.

This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students' school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.";"[Owens, Ann] Univ Southern Calif, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA USA";"Owens, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Sociol, 851 Downey Way,MC 1059, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.";"annowens@usc.edu";NA;NA;"Spencer Foundation [201500113]; Russell Sage Foundation [83-15-01]; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation postdoctoral fellowship";"This research was supported by the Spencer Foundation (Grant 201500113) and the Russell Sage Foundation (Project 83-15-01).

The school competition theory holds that achievement rises when students can choose among competing schools. The school resources theory holds that achievement rises with schools' resources per student. The family resources theory holds that achievement rises as parents become more educated and earn higher incomes. We test all three theories in Chile between 2002 and 2013, when reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, as school competition, school resources, and family resources all increased. We compare Chilean municipalities in a difference-in-differences analysis, asking whether test scores rose fastest in municipalities with greater increases in school competition, school resources, or family resources. We find that municipal test scores did not rise with school competition but did rise with family resources (parental education, not income) and, to a smaller extent, with school resources (as measured by class sizes).

Taking longer to finish one's BA has become so pervasive in the United States that it has become the norm for official statistics released by the Department of Education to report graduation rates across a six-year window. While higher education scholars have increasingly explored how social class impacts college drop-out, attrition, and completion, they have yet to examine the role social class plays in completing a four-year bachelor's degree on time. In this paper, we draw on the most recent cohort of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Survey (2008-2009) to examine who completes their bachelor's degrees on time. Our results indicate that despite controlling for academic performance, educational behaviors, program characteristics, and institutional characteristics, graduates from lower socioeconomic backgrounds do experience difficulties completing their degrees on time. Moreover, our results also reveal that the nature of these relationships vary for traditional and nontraditional students.

The German educational system of early-ability tracking (at age 10) represents a stringent setting for the compensatory hypothesis. Overall, previous literature offers inconclusive findings. Previous research between families suffers from the misspecification of parental SES and ability, while most within-family research did not stratify the analysis by SES or the ability distribution. To address these issues, I draw from the TwinLife study to implement a twin fixed-effects design that minimizes unobserved confounding. I report two main findings. First, highly educated families do not compensate for twins' differences in cognitive ability at the bottom of the ability distribution. In the German system of early-ability tracking, advantaged families may have more difficulties to compensate than in countries where educational transitions are less dependent on ability. Second, holding parents' and children's cognitive ability constant, pupils from highly educated families are 27% more likely to attend the academic track. This result implies wastage of academic potential for disadvantaged families, challenging the role of cognitive ability as the leading criterion of merit for liberal theories of equal opportunity. These findings point to the importance of other factors that vary between families with different resources and explain educational success, such as noncognitive abilities, risk aversion to downward mobility, and teachers' bias.";"[Gil-Hernandez, Carlos J.] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy";"Gil-Hernandez, CJ (corresponding author), European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.";"carlos.gilhernandez@eui.eu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;83;2;2;2;9;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Conversely, women were more than twice as likely as men to earn baccalaureates in a health field, although persistence in health was low for both genders. We show that gender gaps in high school academic achievement, self-assessed math ability, and family-work orientation are only weakly associated with gender gaps in STEM completion and persistence. Gender differences in occupational plans, by contrast, are strongly associated with gender gaps in STEM outcomes, even in models that assume plans are endogenous to academic achievement, self-assessed math ability, and family-work orientation. These results can inform efforts to mitigate gender gaps in STEM attainment.";"[Weeden, Kim A.] Cornell Univ, Social Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Weeden, Kim A.] Cornell Univ, Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Weeden, Kim A.] Cornell Univ, Ctr Study Inequal, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Gelbgiser, Dafna] Tel Aviv Univ, Lab Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Morgan, Stephen L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Krieger Sch Arts & Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Morgan, Stephen L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Educ, Baltimore, MD USA";"Weeden, KA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, 323 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.";"kw74@cornell.edu";"Gelbgiser, Dafna/AAG-4875-2019";NA;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1023798]; Cornell University's Center for the Study of Inequality";"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was partially supported under NSF grant SES-1023798 and by Cornell University's Center for the Study of Inequality.";NA;48;0;0;16;16;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Integrators, who hail from predominantly white high schools, engage majority-white academic networks with ease, do not experience ethnoracial marginalization, and form predominantly white networks in college. Marginalized segregators, who come from predominantly black, Latino/a, or mixed high schools, exhibit discomfort engaging majority-white academic networks, experience ethnoracial marginalization, and form predominantly same-race or co-ethnic networks in college. Finally, social adapters, who come from high schools with varying ethnoracial compositions, manage their experiences with ethnoracial marginalization to engage majority-white academic networks with ease, and the ethnoracial composition of their college networks varies.

Middle-class undergraduates report being at ease in interacting with authority figures and are proactive in doing so. Lower-income undergraduates, however, are split. The privileged poorlower-income undergraduates who attended boarding, day, and preparatory high schoolsenter college primed to engage professors and are proactive in doing so. By contrast, the doubly disadvantagedlower-income undergraduates who remained tied to their home communities and attended local, typically distressed high schoolsare more resistant to engaging authority figures in college and tend to withdraw from them. Through documenting the heterogeneity among lower-income undergraduates, I show how static understandings of individuals' cultural endowments derived solely from family background homogenize the experiences of lower-income undergraduates.

Regression models carried out on a subset of these data indicate that internationalized curricula are more likely in business schools, in universities with international offices, in those with a large number of social science offerings, and in those with membership in international university associations.

Results consistently suggest that passing a bond increases achievement among low- but not high-SES students. However, these benefits for low-SES students are delayed and emerge six years after an election.

However, mobility declines among graduate degree holders. This finding questions the meritocratic power of higher education. Prior research has been hampered, however, by the small samples of advanced degree holders in representative surveys. Drawing on a large longitudinal data set of PhD holders-the Survey of Doctorate Recipients-this study examines intergenerational mobility among the American educational elite, separately for men and women and different racial/ethnic groups. Results show substantial mobility among PhD holders. The association between parents' education and adult children's earnings is moderate among men and nonexistent among women with doctoral degrees. However, women's earnings converge to an average level that is much lower than men's, signaling perverse openness'' for women even at the top of the educational distribution. Among men, there is variation in mobility by race and ethnicity. The intergenerational socioeconomic association is null for Asian men, small for white and black men, and more pronounced for Hispanics. Educational and occupational mediators account for intergenerational association among blacks and whites but not Hispanic men.

This paper questions the continued relevance of this assumption by studying the behavior of guidance counselors charged with implementing New York City's universal high school choice policy. Drawing on structured interviews with 88 middle school counselors and administrative data on choice outcomes at these middle schools, we find that counselors generally believe lower-income students are on their own in making high school choices and need additional adult support. However, they largely refrain from giving action-guiding advice to students about which schools to attend. We elaborate street-level bureaucracy theory by showing how the majority of counselors reduce cognitive dissonance between their understanding of students' needs and their inability to meet these needs adequately given existing resources. They do so by drawing selectively on competing policy logics of school choice, narrowly delineating their conception of their role, and relegating decisions to parents. Importantly, we also find departures from the predictions of this theory as approximately one in four counselors sought to meet the needs of individual students by enlarging their role despite the resource constraints they faced. Finally, we quantify the impact of variation in counselors' approaches, finding that the absence of action-guiding advice is associated with students being admitted to lower-quality schools, on average.";"[Sattin-Bajaj, Carolyn] Seton Hall Univ, Educ Policy, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Sattin-Bajaj, Carolyn] Seton Hall Univ, Ctr Coll Readiness, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Jennings, Jennifer L.] Princeton Univ, Sociol & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Corcoran, Sean P.] NYU, Econ & Educ Policy, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY USA; [Hailey, Chantal] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Baker-Smith, Elizabeth Christine] Temple Univ, HOPE Ctr Coll Commun & Justice, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA";"Sattin-Bajaj, C (corresponding author), Seton Hall Univ, Educ Leadership Management & Policy, 400 South Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.";"sattinca@shu.edu";NA;"Baker-Smith, Christine/0000-0003-0677-4798; Corcoran, Sean/0000-0002-0640-2751";"William T.

However, many students drop out of these schools, leaving with large debts and few job prospects. Despite these dismal outcomes, we know very little about students' experiences in for-profit programs and how these institutions shape postsecondary attainment. Using data from fieldwork with 150 inner-city African American youth, we examine why disadvantaged youth are attracted to these schools and why they struggle to complete certifications. In contrast to previous research, we find that the youth in our study have quite modest ambitions and look to for-profit trade schools as the quickest and most direct route to work. However, youth receive little information or guidance to support such postsecondary transitions. Therefore, the very element that makes for-profit trade school programs seem the most appealinga curriculum focused on one particular careerbecomes an obstacle when it requires youth to commit to a program of study before they have explored their interests. When youth realize they do not like or are not prepared for their chosen career, they adopt coping strategies that keep them in school but swirling between programs, rather than accumulating any credentials.";"[Holland, Megan M.] SUNY Buffalo, Educ Leadership & Policy, Buffalo, NY USA; [DeLuca, Stefanie] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sociol, Baltimore, MD USA";"Holland, MM (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, 477 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.";"mmhollan@buffalo.edu";NA;NA;"William T.

Rarely, however, do we hear from the students on whose performance these rankings are based. This omission is unfortunate for two reasons. First, research suggests that how students explain their academic performance has important consequences for their future achievements. Second, prior studies show that students' attributions of success and failure in education can develop into explanations for social inequalities in adulthood. This article draws on PISA 2012 data on 128,110 secondary school students in 24 countries to explore how educational stratification shapes students' explanations of their academic performance. I find that students in mixed-ability groups tend to attribute their mathematics performance to their teachers and to (bad) luck, whereas vocational- and academic-track students are more likely to blame themselves for not doing well. These differences between mixed-ability group students and tracked students are more pronounced in school systems where tracking is more extensive. I conclude by discussing how these findings speak to the broader impact of educational stratification on students' psychology and cognition and the legitimation of inequalities.";"[Mijs, Jonathan J.

Findings document a rapid, recent rise in new private HEIs and point to supranational normative, mimetic, and coercive pressures that have encouraged nations to expand private higher education, including international development aid trends in peer nations, and linkages to intergovernmental organizations. I argue that while the public-sector HEI has been a long-standing and globally legitimated model for national development, private higher education has historically been associated with some world regions but not others.

Some research claims that inequality grows mainly before school begins. Some research claims that schools cause inequality to grow. And some research-including the 2004 study Are Schools the Great Equalizer?''-claims that inequality grows mainly during summer vacations. Unfortunately, the test scores used in the Great Equalizer study suffered from a measurement artifact that exaggerated estimates of inequality growth. In addition, the Great Equalizer study is dated and its participants are no longer school-aged. In this article, we replicate the Great Equalizer study using better test scores in both the original data and a newer cohort of children. When we use the new test scores, we find that variance is substantial at the start of kindergarten and does not grow but actually shrinks over the next two to three years. This finding, which was not evident in the original Great Equalizer study, implicates the years before kindergarten as the primary source of inequality in elementary reading and math. Total score variance grows during most summers and shrinks during most school years, suggesting that schools reduce inequality overall. Changes in inequality are small after kindergarten and do not replicate consistently across grades, subjects, or cohorts. That said, socioeconomic gaps tend to shrink during the school year and grow during the summer, while the black-white gap tends to follow the opposite pattern.";"[von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Workman, Joseph] Univ Missouri, Dept Sociol, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Downey, Douglas B.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";"von Hippel, PT (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA.";"paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com";NA;NA;"Russell Sage Foundation";"We thank the Russell Sage Foundation for a grant supporting this research.";NA;79;18;19;3;20;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Using educational history data from Russia, we test hypotheses derived from our framework and examine the impact of the Soviet collapse and the ensuing economic recovery. Upgrading exacerbates patterns of socioeconomic stratification by delivering better credentials to individuals with higher levels of initial resources. Sidestepping is less common than upgrading and less related to socioeconomic origins and previous attainment. The Soviet collapse produced short-term declines in the rates of both upgrading and sidestepping.

Scholars have found that boys' early behavioral disadvantage predicts their lower average academic achievement during elementary school. In this study, I examine longer-term effects: Do these early behavioral differences predict boys' lower rates of high school graduation, college enrollment and graduation, and fewer years of schooling completed in adulthood? If so, through what pathways are they linked? I leverage a nationally representative sample of children born in the 1980s to women in their early to mid-20s and followed into adulthood. I use decomposition and path analytic tools to show that boys' higher average levels of behavior problems at age 4 to 5 years help explain the current gender gap in schooling by age 26 to 29, controlling for other observed early childhood factors.

Using data from a field experiment that sent applications to administrative job openings in three major labor markets, we found that employers responded similarly to applicants listing a degree from a fictional college and applicants listing a local for-profit or nonprofit institution.

We gauge how schools' Latino/a student populations are associated with the availability and use of several specific types of discipline. We further explore possible moderating influences of school crime and economic disadvantage on punishment. We find that schools with larger percentages of Latino/a students are more likely to favor certain punitive responses and less likely to favor certain mild responses, as predicted by minority threat.

We focus on the Russian educational system, in which higher education can be accessed from academic and vocational tracks, but the rules of admission to higher education from these tracks are different. Access through the academic track is highly selective due to obligatory high-stakes testing, which determines secondary-school graduates' eligibility to pursue higher education. The vocational track is generally less selective with regard to student intake and provides less restrictive access to higher education. We argue that this system has nuanced implications for social inequality. On one hand, transitions from vocational education to higher education can promote greater social mobility by offering an affordable and low-risk gateway to higher education for children from less-advantaged families. On the other hand, more-advantaged families might use the vocational track to higher education if their children face a high risk of failure in the more selective academic track.

I find heteronormativity permeates preschool classrooms, where teachers construct (and occasionally disrupt) gendered sexuality in a number of different ways, and children reproduce (and sometimes resist) these identities and norms in their daily play. Teachers use what I call facilitative, restrictive, disruptive, and passive approaches to sexual socialization in preschool classrooms. Teachers' approaches to gendered sexual socialization varied across preschools observed and affected teachers' response to children's behaviors, such as heterosexual romantic play (kissing and relationships), bodily displays, and consent. Additionally, my data suggest young children are learning in preschool that boys have gendered power over girls' bodies.

An increasing understanding of racism led students at both institutional types to develop stronger black identities. The processes that led to this heightened awareness of racism, however, differed across institutions. Reflected appraisals (HBCU students' impression that their peers included and accepted them as black and HWCU students' impression that their white peers excluded and labeled them as nonwhite) also played a role in students' strengthening black identities, as did increased contact with black peers (especially for HBCU students).

Furthermore, many studies presume that the yielding of profit from cultural, social, and economic capital is automatic. Bourdieu's concept of field highlights the rules of the game'' and shows that parents' displays of capital only are valuable when they help parents comply with institutional standards. In this article, we examine how the field shapes parents' efforts to transmit advantages to their children through accessing high-status elementary schools. Drawing on interviews with 45 black and white middle-class families, as well as observation of school admission events and interviews with 20 school administrators, we illuminate the rules of the kindergarten admission game and describe how parents attempted to use capital to compete in the field in one large, urban district. We show the rules to be complex, hard to learn about, and implemented inconsistently. In this context, cultural, social, and economic capital that helped parents navigate the field had the potential to be profitable. But even parents with deep reservoirs of capital did not realize their first choice when they misunderstood the rules of the game or faced an imbalance of supply and demand for slots in highly desired schools. Thus, we argue that models need to take into account both the situational meaning of capital and the uncertainty in parents' efforts to use their capital to transmit advantages to their children.";"[Lareau, Annette] Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Evans, Shani Adia] Reed Coll, Sociol, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Yee, April] James Irvine Fdn, San Francisco, CA USA";"Lareau, A (corresponding author), Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.";"alareau@sas.upenn.edu";NA;NA;"Spencer Foundation; Institute of Education Sciences Predoctoral Fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education";"The first author gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Spencer Foundation as well as resources provided by the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Maryland, College Park.

In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (age similar to 9) and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (age similar to 18), I find obesity to be associated with a penalty on academic performance among white girls in English but not in math, while no association is found in either subject for white boys or for black students net of controls.

We consider not only how parents structure their children's after-school time (what parents do) but also how the broader ecology of schooling informs their parenting logics (how they rationalize their actions). We find that parenting practices mirror American research. Upper-middle-class families enroll their children in multiple lessons and cultivate their children's skills. However, unlike their American counterparts, Canadian parenting logics are not explicitly stratification oriented, guided by a desire to access elite universities. Canada's relatively flat stratification system of higher education, where prestige differences between universities are minimal, prompts the emergence of a more expressive parenting ethos. Our findings draw attention to the macrofoundations of social behavior by articulating the connection between parenting logics and educational status hierarchies.

Inductive coding revealed that teachers at each school articulated a shared frame to talk about race and class: legitimated advantage at Heritage High School, trickle-down dysfunction at Bunker High School, and antiracist dignity at Solidarity High School. Each represents an inequality frame: a local meaning system that mediates the dominant race/class ideology, arising from teachers' shared experiences of inequality in the school-as-workplace. The frames I observed responded to three organizational conditions that affected teachers' experiences of inequality: school demographics, material resources, and professional culture.

The Coleman Report suggested that schools play little role in generating achievement gaps, but social scientists have identified many ways in which schools provide better learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children. As a result, a critical perspective that views schools as engines of inequality dominates contemporary sociology of education. However, an important body of empirical research challenges this critical view. To reconcile the field's main ideas with this new evidence, we propose a refraction framework, a perspective on schools and inequality guided by the assumption that schools may shape inequalities along different dimensions in different ways. From this more balanced perspective, schools might indeed reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities, but they also might compensate for otherssocioeconomic disparities in cognitive skills in particular. We conclude by discussing how the mostly critical perspective on schools and inequality is costly to the field of sociology of education.";"[Downey, Douglas B.] Ohio State Univ, Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Condron, Dennis J.] Oakland Univ, Sociol, Rochester, MI 48063 USA";"Downey, DB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 238 Townshend Hall,1885 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.";"downey.32@sociology.osu.edu";NA;NA;"Paul von Hippel, William T.

However, we find that the association differs by race, such that the link between student debt and returning home is stronger for black than for white youth. Third, degree completion is a strong predictor of returning home, whereby those who fail to attain a degree have an increased risk of boomeranging.

Using panel data on complete classroom networks of approximately 3,000 adolescents and their parents in approximately 200 classes in both Germany and the Netherlands, we compare estimates based on between-student differences in intergenerational networks (i.e., between-individual estimates) to estimates based on changes students experience in their intergenerational networks over time (i.e., within-individual estimates). We also examine how the relationship between intergenerational networks and grades is contingent on students' location in the educational system (i.e., their ability track). When considering between-individual estimates, we find some support for a positive relationship between intergenerational networks and grades. However, we find no robust support when considering within-individual estimates. The findings suggest that between-individual estimates, which most previous research has relied on, may be confounded by unobserved differences across individuals.

We suggest educational debt plays a key role in social stratification by either deterring bachelor's degree holders from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds from pursuing lucrative careers through advanced degree programs or imposing a high cost for entry. We speculate that the ongoing personal financing of advanced degrees, changes to funding in higher education, and increasing returns to and demand for postbaccalaureate degrees have created a perfect storm for those seeking degrees beyond college. We find that aggregate increases in borrowing among advanced degree students between 1996 and 2016 can be explained in part by increasing enrollment rates, particularly among master's degree students, and large, secular increases in graduate and professional students' undergraduate and graduate borrowing. In contrast to undergraduate debt alone, the burden of educational debt among graduate borrowers appears to have fallen on students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and historically underserved students of color more so than their more advantaged counterparts and on women more so than men. However, we also find that median advanced degree wage premia over those of bachelor's degree holders are substantial for many who graduate with advanced degrees but are particularly high for African American and low socioeconomic status graduates, complicating simple conclusions about the stratification of debt at the postgraduate level.";"[Pyne, Jaymes] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Grodsky, Eric] Univ Wisconsin, Sociol & Educ Policy Studies, Madison, WI USA";"Pyne, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";"jaymes.pyne@stanford.edu";NA;"Pyne, Jaymes/0000-0003-2570-5384";NA;NA;NA;60;2;2;8;16;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Parenting programs are often offered in schools, with instructors teaching pregnant or parenting teens about child development, attachment, and discipline strategies. Despite the large numbers of participants and significant public and private funding going to parenting education, sociologists of education in the United States have paid little attention to the topic. Existing research, by scholars in other disciplines, has found parenting education to be a relatively weak intervention. Yet this research focuses exclusively on individual-level processes, paying little attention to social context or other factors. This study uses extensive observational and interview data from parenting education programs in two schools and one social service organization to examine what is taught, what is not, and the intersections between program content and the structural realities shaping parents' lives. The results show that although they were designed for low-income mothers, the classes were silent on the issue of poverty, treating poverty-related concerns as irrelevant to the task of parenting. Furthermore, when such topics did emerge, instructors redirected the conversations to personal behaviors and characteristics. Thus, the ''hidden curriculum'' of parenting education conveyed the message that good parenting should be unaffected by the challenges of poverty. The mothers, however, struggled to provide for their children in conditions of extreme scarcity, making it difficult for them to focus on other parenting issues.";"[Cucchiara, Maia; Clark, Monica] Temple Univ, Urban Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Cassar, Erin] Sch Dist Philadelphia, Off Res & Evaluat, Philadelphia, PA USA";"Cucchiara, M (corresponding author), Temple Univ, 266 Ritter Hall,1301 CB Moore Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.";"maia.cucchiara@temple.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;60;0;0;2;16;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

The current study tests this possibility, analyzing whether and in what ways childhood suspensions increase children's risk for juvenile arrests. Combining 15 years of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study with contextual information on neighborhoods and schools, I find that suspensions disproportionately affect children already enduring considerable adversity. Even so, suspensions appear to redirect children's trajectories, more than doubling their risk of arrest. Although suspended children experienced greater escalations in behavioral problems than their peers, post-suspension behavioral changes explained relatively little of the association between early suspension and later arrest. Instead, the most consequential way suspended children diverged from their peers was their heightened risk for repeated school sanction. Suspended children's risk for repeated school removal explained 52 percent of the association between childhood suspension and juvenile arrest.";"[Mittleman, Joel] Princeton Univ, Sociol & Social Policy, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";"Mittleman, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, 104 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.";"joeljm@princeton.edu";NA;NA;"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health [R01HD36916, R01HD39135, R01HD40421]";"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01HD36916, R01HD39135, and R01HD40421, as well as a consortium of private foundations.

I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing.

It contributes to the overeducation literature in several ways. First, matching is measured from the perspective of employers, who are better informed about job requirements than employees. Second, overeducated applicants are compared to matched applicants competing for the same job opening. This shift in focus toward applicant pools is necessary to properly test whether overeducation is rewarded during the hiring process, the central tenet of job competition theory. Third, vertical and horizontal mismatches are analyzed jointly: This more fine-grained differentiation refines sociological perspectives on credentialism and reveals the complex ways in which employers assign applicants to jobs. Results show that Dutch employers apply more rigid hiring floors and more strongly penalize horizontal mismatches: Compared to England, in the Netherlands, overeducation cannot compensate for the lack of occupation-specific training.";"[Di Stasio, Valentina] Univ Oxford, Sociol, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England";"Di Stasio, V (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, 1 New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.";"valentina.distasio@nuffield.ox.ac.uk";NA;NA;"Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VIDI grant [452-07-002]; Programme Council for Fundamental Research of the Netherlands Initiative for Education Research [411-10-920]";"The author gratefully acknowledges funding support from the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VIDI grant assigned to Prof. Herman G. van de Werfhorst (grant number 452-07-002) and a grant from the Programme Council for Fundamental Research of the Netherlands Initiative for Education Research (grant number 411-10-920).

We use a comparative case study approach; our dataset comprises global policy documents and original interviews (n = 147) and observations in 14 refugee-hosting nation-states. We analyze how the purposes of refugee education are understood and acted upon by actors occupying diverse positions across these nation-states and over time. We demonstrate that the articulated purposes of refugee education are oriented toward possible futures for refugees, and they presuppose refugees' access to quality education, social belonging, and economic opportunities. Yet we find that across nation-states of exile, refugees' access to these resources is tenuous. Our findings suggest reconceptualizing refugee education to reflect how refugees are simultaneously embedded within multiple national contexts and to address the exclusions they face within each one.

Using a newly constructed quantitative panel data set of 139 countries from 1960 to 2010, I show that a majority of countries around the world have shifted away from sharply tracked institutions at the junior secondary level toward more formally open and comprehensive ones. To explain this trend, I argue that worldwide shifts away from more stratified and corporatist conceptions of the polity toward more liberal models led to the construction of norms of individual egalitarianism in the educational process, and this process delegitimated tracking at early ages. Findings from a series of panel regression models indicate that countries that are more formally committed to individual rights and universalistic conceptions of the educational process are less likely to track students at the junior secondary level; some nation-specific characteristics, such as levels of economic development, also shape tracking at lower levels of schooling. Most countries, however, continue to track students at the senior secondary level. The persistence of tracking at this level suggests a tension between existing conceptions of education as a mechanism for both propagating equality and allocating individuals to unequal opportunities.";"[Furuta, Jared] Stanford Univ, Sociol, 450 Serra Mall,Bldg 120, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";"Furuta, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sociol, 450 Serra Mall,Bldg 120, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";"jkfuruta@stanford.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;86;1;1;1;3;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Therefore, parents' education may imbue children with high expectations but not always the means to fulfill them. Swedish data on children of immigrants from over 100 countries of origin support this view: Net of parents' absolute years of schooling, a high rank in the sending country benefits children's aspirations, attitudes, and educational choices but not their test scores or school grades.

Drawing on interviews with administrators, transfer services personnel, and transfer-intending students at two Texas community college districts and with administrators, admissions staff, and transfer personnel at public universities throughout the state, we examine how institutional actors and students create, maintain, and respond to rules and norms in the community college transfer field. Our results suggest university administrators, faculty, and staff hold dominant positions in the field, setting the rules and norms for credit transfer and applicability. Students, who hold the least privilege, must invest time and energy to gather information about transfer pathways and policies as their primary means of meeting their educational aspirations. The complex structure of information-wherein each institution provides its own transfer resources, with little collaboration and minimal alignment-systematically disadvantages community college students.

Using newly developed methods for estimating longitudinal treatment effects, we find that cumulative neighborhood disadvantage in adolescence is strongly associated with lower bachelor's attainment among high-income blacks and Latinos. We find no effect for whites and at most a modest effect among low- and middle-income blacks/Latinos. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the estimated effect for high-income blacks/Latinos is plausibly causal.

How do we understand the work of teaching in this new context of control? In this article, I use the case of an urban, no-excuses'' charter school to examine how teachers responded to the school's intensive effort to socialize them into a uniform set of disciplinary practices. Drawing from 15 months of fieldwork at a no-excuses school, I found that teachers varied in their responses to school control based on their cultural toolkitstheir preferences and their capacities. Based on teachers' adaptation strategies, I introduce four ideal types: conformers, imitators, adaptors, and rejecters. This article makes the following contributions. First, I extend classic theories of teacher self-socialization to a new context of control. Second, I offer new ways beyond sensemaking theories to analyze how and why teachers adopt (or fail to adopt) new teaching practices.

After proposing a reduced-form version of Adelman's curricular intensity index comprised of number of courses completed in English and core science, highest math course completed, and whether students took at least one Advanced Placement course, I test the measure in four National Center for Education Statistics high school longitudinal studies using confirmatory factor analysis. I examine the methodological implications of the measure by conducting multigroup tests for invariance across cohorts to understand how curricular intensity changes over time and comparing the measure's predictive validity to that of alternative measures of course taking. I then examine substantive implications of the measure through analysis of trends and inequalities in curricular intensity. The four course-taking variables combined create a strong measure of curricular intensity across cohorts that performs as well as or better than Adelman's index in explaining variance in postsecondary outcomes and predicting postsecondary success. The measure accounts for shifts over time in the relative contribution of each course-taking variable to overall curricular intensity, facilitating more accurate comparisons across cohorts or data sets. I provide practical guidance for using the measure in other data sets, including state- and district-level data, to analyze overall trends and gaps in curricular intensity and its role in postsecondary success, and I discuss some potential uses of the measure for future research and policy.";"[Austin, Megan] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC USA";"Austin, M (corresponding author), Amer Inst Res, 10 S Riverside Plaza,Suite 600, Chicago, IL 60606 USA.";"maustin@air.org";NA;"Austin, Megan/0000-0002-3943-3642";"Center for Research on Educational Opportunity (CREO) at the University of Notre Dame; Institute for Educational Initiatives at the University of Notre Dame; American Educational Research Association - National Science Foundation [DRL-0941014]; Minnesota Population Center through Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [P2C HD041023]";"This work was supported by The Center for Research on Educational Opportunity (CREO) and the Institute for Educational Initiatives at the University of Notre Dame and by a grant from the American Educational Research Association, which receives funds for its AERA Grants Program'' from the National Science Foundation under Grant DRL-0941014.

Our findings suggest cheating scandals tend to arise when rule-breaking decisions shift toward higher levels of the educational bureaucracy, and school and district leaders enact multiple strategies to motivate coordinated cheating efforts among lower-level educators.

Given prior research on effectively maintained inequality, we theorize that classroom sorting acts as an opportunity for privileged parents to obtain a qualitative advantage for their children. Our research uses administrative data from Indiana and hierarchical linear models to analyze classroom mismatch in sixth through eighth grades. We find that privileged students are more likely to be overmatched in both math and English language arts (ELA) classrooms but that overmatching is beneficial in math but detrimental in ELA.

However, recent expansions of school choice policies that allow parents to select schools outside their neighborhood raise questions as to whether this weakening of the neighborhood-school connection might influence the residential decisions of higher-socioeconomic-status white households looking to relocate to central city neighborhoods. This study examines whether and the extent to which expanded school choice facilitates the gentrification of disinvested, racially segregated urban communities. Drawing data from the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the National Center for Educational Statistics, and the Schools and Staffing Survey, this study finds evidence that college-educated white households are far more likely to gentrify communities of color when school choice options expand. In particular, the expansion of school choice increases the likelihood of gentrification by up to 22 percentage points in the most racially isolated neighborhoods of colormore than twice the baseline likelihood for such communities.";"[Pearman, Francis A., II] Univ Pittsburgh, Urban Educ, Ctr Urban Educ, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Swain, Walker A.] Univ Georgia, Educ Adm & Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA";"Pearman, FA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Educ, Ctr Urban Educ, 4118 Wesley W Posvar Hall,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.";"apearman@pitt.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;64;24;24;0;30;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

In this study I examine how peers influence each other's decision to apply to an academic track in upper-secondary education through these two functions of peer influence. The results show that students are more likely to conform to their in-group peers. However, discouraging effects are structured differently, whereby expectations about self- and peer achievement seem to be a mediating factor. This suggests that the point of reference varies with the mechanism mediating interpersonal influence together with characteristics of both peers and egos.

Rather than generating highly valued capital within the field of education, it produces what we call shadow capital. As a distinct form of cultural capital, shadow capital outwardly resembles yet contains only traces of dominant cultural capital, thus failing to yield the same kind of exchange value in the postsecondary marketplace. Shadow capital offers explanatory power for the many unmet promises of educational reform and further challenges the often well-intended democratizing forces that paradoxically reinforce inequality in education.";"[Cipollone, Kristin] Ball State Univ, Elementary Educ, 2000 W Univ Ave, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Stich, Amy E.] Northern Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL USA";"Cipollone, K (corresponding author), Ball State Univ, Elementary Educ, 2000 W Univ Ave, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.";"kncipollone@bsu.edu";NA;"Stich, Amy/0000-0002-1260-5088";"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL 1008215, DRL 1007964]";"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (award DRL 1008215 to Lois Weis and DRL 1007964 to Margaret Eisenhart).";NA;46;6;6;4;16;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

This study argues that the evidence supporting this consensus may be distorted by two problems: measurement error in parents' socioeconomic standing and the educational system's tendency to progressively select people predisposed for mobility rather than to actually affect mobility. Analyses of family income mobility that address both of these problems in three longitudinal surveys converge on new findings. Intergenerational mobility is significantly lower among high school dropouts than among others, but there are no significant differences in mobility across higher education levels.

We examine how families' nearby school supply shapes and constrains their choices. Drawing on a unique dataset consisting of parents' ranked preferences from among one urban district's full menu of public schools, we find that Hispanic, white, and black parents share a strong preference for academic performance, but differences in their choices can be traced to variation in nearby supply.

We find that studying abroad was socially selective during the entire observation period. Selectivity increased between 1991 and 2003 and hardly changed thereafter. Unexpectedly, the expansion of higher education does not explain this development. We also find that students from a high social background are more likely to choose exclusive types of stays abroad, that is, prolonged stays and stays funded through study-abroad scholarships. Regarding access to scholarships, social inequality increased as studying abroad became less exclusive. High-background students thus seem to replace their prior practices with more exclusive study-abroad practices.";"[Netz, Nicolai] German Ctr Higher Educ Res & Sci Studies DZHW, Goseriede 9, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Finger, Claudia] Berlin Social Sci Ctr WZB, Res Unit Skill Format & Labor Market, Berlin, Germany";"Netz, N (corresponding author), German Ctr Higher Educ Res & Sci Studies DZHW, Goseriede 9, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.";"netz@dzhw.eu";NA;"Netz, Nicolai/0000-0002-7272-3502";NA;NA;NA;49;24;25;0;36;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Sociologists of education have been leaders in this area, researching how affluent families position their children to compete favorably in a highly stratified higher education system. However, scholars have done less research on how students do symbolic work of their own to bolster elite status. In this study, we use qualitative interviews with 56 undergraduates at Harvard and Stanford Universities to explore how students construct a status hierarchy among elite campuses. Students come to campus with a working knowledge of prestige differences between top institutions but then are influenced by others to refine their perceptions. We find that Harvard and Stanford students value universities that offer a ''well-rounded'' liberal arts education while criticizing other selective institutions for being, alternatively, too intellectual, connected to the old-world status system, overly associated with partying and athletics, or having a student body too single-minded about career preparation.

In this study, we explore the association between family socioeconomic status and learning outcomes in 10 francophone African countries using data from the Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems, a standardized assessment of pupils' mathematics and reading competence at the end of primary school. We start by showing that learning outcomes among grade 6 pupils are both poor and highly stratified. We then develop and test a conceptual framework that highlights three mechanisms through which family socioeconomic status might contribute to learning: (1) educational resources at home, (2) health and well-being, and (3) differences in school quality. We find that most of the effect of family background on learning outcomes operates through school quality, which results from a combination of the unequal distribution of resources (such as teachers and textbooks) across schools and high socioeconomic segregation between schools. On the basis of these results, we suggest that most countries in the region could improve equity as well as overall performance by raising the floor in school quality.";"[Gruijters, Rob J.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Educ & Int Dev, Cambridge, England; [Behrman, Julia A.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Chicago, IL 60611 USA";"Gruijters, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, REAL Ctr, 184 Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 8PQ, England.";"rjg85@cam.ac.uk";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;78;0;0;8;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Some students are motivated by potential economic returns, others want to take engaging classes, and others still would like opportunities to help people in their jobs. But how do these preferences map onto students' actual major choices? This question is particularly intriguing in light of gender differences in fields of study, as men and women may take divergent pathways in pursuit of the same outcome. Using data from the Pathways through College Study (N = 2,639), I show that men and women choose very different majors even when they cite the same major preferences-what I call gendered logics of major choice. In addition, I use earnings data from the American Community Survey to assess how these gendered logics of major choice may be associated with broader patterns of earnings inequality. I find that among men and women who have the same major preferences, men's major choices are tied to significantly higher prospective earnings than women's major choices. This finding demonstrates that the ways men and women translate their preferences into majors are unequal from an earnings perspective.

Analyses of longitudinal administrative data following approximately 20,000 eighth graders enrolled in 23 middle schools through the 10th grade indicate that these dimensions of tracking are empirically separable and have divergent relationships with student achievement and the production of inequality.";"[Domina, Thurston] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Educ Policy & Org Leadership, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [McEachin, Andrew] RAND, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Hanselman, Paul] Univ Calif Irvine, Sociol, Irvine, CA USA; [Agarwal, Priyanka] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, Irvine, CA USA; [Hwang, NaYoung] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Lewis, Ryan W.] WestEd, Comprehens Sch Assistance Program, Sacramento, CA USA";"Domina, T (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Peabody Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.";"tdomina@email.unc.edu";"McEachin, Andrew/Y-4909-2019";"McEachin, Andrew/0000-0002-5113-6616";"Spencer Foundation [201400180]";"Research reported in this publication was supported by Spencer Foundation (Grant No. 201400180).

Using the life course framework of cumulative advantage, we investigate how timing, individual FRL status, and legacy effects of a student's elementary school SES composition each affect a student's math achievement growth. We advance research on school transitions by considering how changing contexts affect achievement growth across school transitions. Furthermore, we improve on school context research by measuring the ways that SES compositions across school transitions may be interconnected. Using state administrative panel data for third through eighth graders from 2009 to 2015, we use fixed effects to estimate math achievement growth by the end of eighth grade. Findings suggest that a student's elementary SES composition has a legacy effect on middle school achievement growth net of his or her own achievement growth and middle school SES composition.

Nowhere is this question better addressed than in Singapore, the emblematic modern-day meritocracy where education has long been hailed as the most important ticket to elite status. In particular, what accounts for gender and ethnic gaps in enrollment into Singapore's elite junior colleges-the key sorters in the country's education system? We consider how the wealth of neighborhoods has combined with the elite status of schools to affect the social mobility of gender and ethnic groups. Analyzing data from 40 years of junior college yearbooks (1971-2010), we find persistent differences in educational opportunity. Women and Malays have historically experienced inequality in Singapore, and their student routes to becoming elites differ markedly. For female students, attending an elite junior college in a wealthy neighborhood is associated with wealthy neighborhoods that have a disproportionate number of elite girls' secondary schools that feed into the junior colleges. By contrast, for Malays, not attending an elite junior college in a wealthy neighborhood has more to do with wealthy neighborhoods underrepresenting Malays in demographic composition. Elite families thus now include better educated women as well as men, yet Malays still rarely become better educated elites. These results underscore the need to carefully map the complex associations and mechanisms between gender and ethnic categorizations, the status of schools, and the characteristics of neighborhoods.";"[Chua, Vincent] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol, 11 Arts Link,AS1 04-27, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Swee, Eik Leong] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wellman, Barry] NetLab Network, Toronto, ON, Canada";"Chua, V (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol, 11 Arts Link,AS1 04-27, Singapore 117570, Singapore.";"socckhv@nus.edu.sg";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;125;4;4;1;7;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

One view is that schools are an important mechanism for perpetuating inequality because children from advantaged backgrounds (white and high socioeconomic) enjoy better school learning environments than their disadvantaged peers. But it is difficult to know this with confidence because children's development is a product of both school and nonschool factors, making it a challenge to isolate school's role. A novel approach for isolating school effects is to estimate the difference in learning when school is in versus out, what is called impact. Scholars employing this strategy have come to a remarkable conclusion-that schools serving disadvantaged children produce as much learning as those serving advantaged children. The empirical basis for this position is modest, however, and so we address several shortcomings of the previous research by analyzing a nationally representative sample of about 3,500 children in 270 schools from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2011. With more comprehensive data and better scales, we also find no difference in impact on reading scores across schools serving poor or black children versus those serving nonpoor or white children. These patterns challenge the view that differences in school quality play an important role shaping achievement gaps and prompt us to reconsider theoretical positions regarding schools and inequality.";"[Downey, Douglas B.; Alcaraz, Melissa] Ohio State Univ, Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Quinn, David M.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Educ, Los Angeles, CA USA";"Downey, DB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 1885 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.";"downey32@gmail.com";NA;"Alcaraz, Melissa/0000-0003-3813-5683";NA;NA;NA;53;1;1;1;8;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Contexts of instability and bureaucratic complexity serve as barriers to registering months in advance, and parents describe disengagement from the school system following their late registration. These findings show how despite equal access in theory, bureaucratic structures such as timeline-based lotteries hinder many families, particularly those disadvantaged already, from full participation.

In this article, we examine how social psychological factorsin particular, individuals' perceptions of schools with varying demographic characteristicsmay contribute to the ongoing structural problem of school segregation. We investigate the effects of school racial composition and several nonracial school characteristics on white parents' school enrollment decisions for their children as well as how racial stereotypes shape the school choice process. We use data from a survey-based experiment we designed to test pure race'' and racial proxy'' hypotheses regarding parents' enrollment preferences. We also use a measure of pro-white stereotype bias, both alone and in combination with school racial composition (percentage black). Using logistic regression analysis, we find support for the pure race'' hypothesis. The proportion of black students in a hypothetical school has a consistent and significant inverse association with the likelihood of white parents enrolling their children in that school net of the effects of the included racial proxy measures. In addition, higher levels of pro-white stereotype bias further inhibit enrollment, particularly in schools with higher proportions of black students.

The late-twentieth-century global expansion of higher education ushered in new transformations, propelling societal rationalization and organizing, and knitting the world into a more integrated society and economy. We address four key dynamics: (1) Higher education sustains the modern professions and contributes to the rationalization of society and state. (2) The supranational and universalistic orientation of higher education provides elites with shared global cultural frames and identities, facilitating globalization. (3) Consequently, tertiary education provides a foundation for major global movements and sociopolitical change around diverse issues, such as human rights and environmental protection as well as potentially contentious religious and cultural solidarities. (4) Higher education contributes to the reorganization of the economy, creating new monetarized activities and facilitating the reconceptualization of activities distant from material production as economic. In short, many features of the contemporary world arise from the growing legions of people steeped in common forms of higher education.

Most prior research in this area focuses on the significantly higher rates of punishment among African American boys, but in this article, we turn our attention to the discipline of African American girls. Using advanced multilevel models and a longitudinal data set of detailed school discipline records, we analyze interactions between race and gender on office referrals. The results show troubling and significant disparities in the punishment of African American girls. Controlling for background variables, black girls are three times more likely than white girls to receive an office referral; this difference is substantially wider than the gap between black boys and white boys. Moreover, black girls receive disproportionate referrals for infractions such as disruptive behavior, dress code violations, disobedience, and aggressive behavior. We argue that these infractions are subjective and influenced by gendered interpretations. Using the framework of intersectionality, we propose that school discipline penalizes African American girls for behaviors perceived to transgress normative standards of femininity.";"[Morris, Edward W.] Univ Kentucky, Sociol, Lexington, KY USA; [Perry, Brea L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN USA; [Perry, Brea L.] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN USA";"Morris, EW (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Sociol, 1515 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.";"edward.morris@uky.edu";NA;NA;"Spencer Foundation";"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a grant from the Spencer Foundation.

Drawing on theories of socialization and deviance, I explore how suspension events influence students' emotional engagement in school through changes in their attitudes. Using longitudinal middle school survey data connected to individual student administrative records, I find that students who receive out-of-school suspensions are psychologically vulnerable prior to their removal from school. Accounting for demographic characteristics of students, prior year disciplinary involvement, and students' beginning-of-year attitudes, I find suspensions might further harm students by negatively changing their academic identities and perceptions of adults in school.

Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 linked to the U.S. Census 2000, I focus on local economic variation in the share of jobs that do not demand a bachelor's degree. I find that schools in local labor markets with higher concentrations of subbaccalaureate jobs devote a larger share of their course offerings to career and technical education (CTE) courses and a smaller share to advanced college-preparatory courses compared to schools in labor markets with lower concentrations of subbaccalaureate jobs, even net of school resources. Students in labor markets with higher concentrations of subbaccalaureate jobs take greater numbers of CTE courses, and higher-achieving students in these labor markets are less likely to take advanced math and Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate courses. These course-taking disparities are largely due to school course offerings.

Schools more committed to enlarged conceptions of student personhood are more likely to adopt a test-optional policy, in order to recruit students who fit the distinctive characteristics of their school identity. To test the argument, I use a comprehensive data set of 1,640 colleges and universities in the United States and discrete-time event history models from 1987 to 2015.

Yet despite the promise and prevalence of data-driven policies and practices, inequalities persist. Indeed, contemporary scholarship has begun to question whether and how processes such as quantification and commensuration contribute to rather than remediate inequality. Using the 2013 closure of 24 Philadelphia public schools as a case study, I employ a mixed-methods approach to illuminate quantification and commensuration as nuanced processes with contingent, dualistic, and paradoxical relationships to inequality. The quantified approach to selecting schools for closure predisposed poor and minority communities to institutional loss because academic underperformance, a key selection metric, was correlated with disadvantage. Paradoxically, academic performance measures, coupled with commensuration strategies, also enabled advocates to successfully overturn closure recommendations.

Some prior studies have investigated race differences in parental college savings, yet none have taken an intersectional approach, and most of these studies were conducted with cohorts of students who predate key demographic changes among U.S. college goers (e.g., the reversal of the gender gap in college completion). Drawing on theories of parental investment and data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), we show that both race and gender are associated with whether parents save for college, as well as how much they save. Both black boys and black girls experience savings disadvantages relative to their white peers. However, black girls experience particularly striking disparities: Black girls with the strongest academic credentials receive savings equivalent to black girls with the weakest academic credentials. Results suggest this is due, at least in part, to the fact that high-achieving black girls tend to come from families that are much less well-off than high achievers in other race-gender groups. As a result, parents of black girls frequently rely on funding sources other than their own earnings or savings to pay for their children's college. These funding sources include private loans that may pose financial challenges for black girls and their families across generations, thus deepening inequalities along the lines of gender, race, and class. These findings demonstrate the power of taking an intersectional approach to the study of higher education in general and college funding in particular.";"[Quadlin, Natasha] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Conwell, Jordan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sociol, Madison, WI USA";"Quadlin, N (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, 264 Haines Hall,375 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.";"quadlin@soc.ucla.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;64;0;0;1;1;"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC";"THOUSAND OAKS";"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA";"0038-0407";"1939-8573";NA;"SOCIOL EDUC";"Sociol.

Yet, year after year at the most selective universities, nearly half the graduating seniors head to a surprisingly narrow band of professional options. Over the past few decades, this has largely been into the finance and consulting sectors, but increasingly it also includes high-tech firms. This study uses a cultural-organizational lens to show how student cultures and campus structures steer large portions of anxious and uncertain students into high-wealth, high-status occupational sectors. Interviewing 56 students and recent alumni at Harvard and Stanford Universities, we found that the majority of our respondents experienced confusion about career paths when first arriving at college but quickly learned what were considered to be the most prestigious options. On-campus corporate recruitment for finance, consulting, and high-tech jobs functioned as a significant driver of student perceptions of status; career prestige systems built up among peers exacerbated the funneling effect into these jobs. From these processes, students learned to draw boundaries between high-status'' and ordinary'' jobs. Our findings demonstrate how status processes on college campuses are central in generating preferences for the uppermost positions in the occupational structure and that elite campus environments have a large, independent role in the production and reproduction of social inequality.";"[Binder, Amy J.; Davis, Daniel B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sociol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bloom, Nick] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27706 USA";"Binder, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.";"abinder@ucsd.edu";"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019";NA;"Kauffman Foundation; Spencer Foundation; University of California, San DiegoUniversity of California System";"We are grateful to the Kauffman Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, and the University of California, San Diego, for their generous support of this project.

This article addresses this concern by studying how schools and districts utilize counselors. Through interviews and observations of high school counselors, administrators, and counselor educators in an urban midwestern community, I find that counselors suffer from role ambiguity and role conflict due to lack of a clear job description, overlap with similar professions, supervision by noncounseling administrators, inadequate forms of performance evaluation, and conflict between their roles as counselors and educators. This conflict leads to poor boundaries at work, with counselors receiving an overwhelming amount of noncounseling duties that reduce their time with students. High school counselors have the potential to improve student social and academic outcomes, but these obstacles of role ambiguity and role conflict reduce them to school managers rather than master's-level trained educators with a mental health background.";"[Blake, Mary Kate] Valparaiso Univ, Sociol & Criminol Dept, 1400 Chapel Dr Rm 337, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA";"Blake, MK (corresponding author), Valparaiso Univ, Sociol & Criminol Dept, 1400 Chapel Dr Rm 337, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA.";"marykate.blake@valpo.edu";NA;NA;"William T.

I find that parents are more likely to opt out of neighborhood schools in gentrifying neighborhoods compared with non-gentrifying neighborhoods when nearby choice options are available.

However, the memorial costs and benefits of inferring word meanings from context, compared to seeing definitions of unfamiliar words before reading, are not yet well understood. We conducted two experiments with adult L1 (English) and L2 (Chinese) readers to investigate whether the development of declarative and nondeclarative word knowledge benefits more when definitions are supplied before reading (errorless treatment) or after reading (trial-and-error treatment). Study participants encountered 90 target vocabulary items three times in short informative texts under errorless or trial-and-error conditions and entered their meaning inferences immediately after reading each text. Posttreatment, we evaluated participants' declarative knowledge of the target items using a meaning generation (recall) task and nondeclarative knowledge using a self-paced reading task. The trial-and-error treatment followed by definitions resulted in a superior declarative and nondeclarative knowledge, compared to the errorless treatment, for L1 and L2 readers. Inference errors affected the development of declarative but not nondeclarative knowledge, and the trajectory of the development of nondeclarative knowledge was different for L1 and L2 readers.

Sixty-two collegiate intermediate-level Chinese learners including 37 CHL learners and 25 non-CHL learners participated in this study. Drawing on multivariate analyses, the study found that CHL learners outperformed non-CHL learners on oral vocabulary knowledge, morphological awareness, and lexical inferencing ability, but not on print vocabulary knowledge. In both groups of learners, print vocabulary knowledge was the strongest predictor of lexical inferencing ability. While oral vocabulary knowledge and print vocabulary knowledge were highly correlated in non-CHL learners, they were more distinct constructs in CHL learners. These findings seem to suggest that early exposure to spoken Chinese enhances the development of oral vocabulary knowledge and morphological awareness in CHL learners. Importantly, the latter appears to enhance the formation of the connection between oral vocabulary knowledge and print knowledge.";"[Zhang, Haomin; Koda, Keiko] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";"Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Modern Languages, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.";"haominz@andrew.cmu.edu";"Zhang, Haomin/AAF-4802-2020";"Zhang, Haomin/0000-0002-9439-1625";"Small Research Grant of the Department of Modern Languages, Carnegie Mellon University";"This study was funded by the Small Research Grant of the Department of Modern Languages, Carnegie Mellon University.

This belief is somewhat at odds with research that consistently shows beginning learners making quick gains through focused tone training, as well as research showing advanced learners achieving near-native performance in tone identification tasks. However, other long-term difficulties related to L2 tone perception may persist, given the additional demands of word recognition and the effects of context. In the current study, we used behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) experiments to test whether perception of Mandarin tones is difficult for advanced L2 learners in isolated syllables, disyllabic words in isolation, and disyllabic words in sentences. Stimuli were more naturalistic and challenging than in previous research. While L2 learners excelled at tone identification in isolated syllables, they performed with very low accuracy in rejecting disyllabic tonal nonwords in isolation and in sentences. We also report ERP data from critical mismatching words in sentences; while L2 listeners showed no significant differences in responses in any condition, trends were not inconsistent with the overall pattern in behavioral results of less sensitivity to tone mismatches than to semantic or segmental mismatches. We interpret these results as evidence that Mandarin tones are in fact difficult for advanced L2 learners. However, the difficulty is not due primarily to an inability to perceive tones phonetically, but instead is driven by the need to process tones lexically, especially in multisyllable words.";"[Pelzl, Eric; Lau, Ellen F.; DeKeyser, Robert] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Guo, Taomei] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Pelzl, E (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Second Language Acquisit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.";"pelzlea@gmail.com";NA;NA;"NSF-IGERT grant [0801465]; NSF-EAPSINational Science Foundation (NSF) [1514936]";"Thanks to Junjie Wu, Di Lu, Yongben Fu, and Chunyan Kang for help running participants in Beijing, to Man Li for help proofreading initial rounds of Chinese stimuli, to Anna Chrabaszcz for helpful advice and Matlab scripts, and to Brendan Cone for help editing many, many sound files.

While these L1s share similar phonological restrictions on consonant cluster formation needed for English past tense morphology, differences arise in L1 syntax (only Mandarin lacks syntactic past) and L1 prosodic structure (only Japanese has English-equivalent structure). Aggregate analyses indicate that an L1 English control group outperforms all L2 groups in oral suppliance of past tense morphology. Results therefore reveal that having the syntactic feature for past in the L1 does not translate into targetlike performance and that L1 phonological restrictions alone cannot fully explain nontargetlike performance.

It can also inform practical decisions about using L2 readings in academic study. Monitoring readers' eye movements provides real-time data on word learning, under the conditions that closely approximate adult L2 vocabulary acquisition from reading. In this study, Dutch-speaking university students read an English expository text, while their eye movements were recorded. Of interest were patterns of change in the eye movements on the target low-frequency words that occurred multiple times in the text, and whether differences in the processing of target and control (known) words decreased overtime. Target word reading outside of the familiar text was examined in a posttest using semantically neutral sentences.

Previous research has demonstrated that L1 and advanced L2 speakers are sensitive to phrasal frequency and con-tingency when processing larger-than-word units. However, it remains unclear whether such statistical sensitivity is robust across tasks and among subcategories of MWS. In addition, little is known about whether cognitive aptitudes can moderate such sensitivity. This study examined L1 and advanced L2 speakers' statistical sensitivity to phrasal frequency and contingency as well as cognitive aptitudes' moderating effects on such sensitivity when processing English adjective - noun collocations. Participants performed a phrasal acceptability judgment task (PJT). Meanwhile, their aptitude profiles were measured by six aptitude tests, which loaded separately onto implicit language aptitude, explicit language aptitude, and working memory capacity. Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that both L1 and L2 English speakers were sensitive to phrasal frequency and contingency of collocations, although L2 speakers' sensitivity was much stronger than that of L1 speakers. None of the aptitudes was found to moderate language users' statistical sensitivity to either collocation frequency or contingency. Interestingly, disassociation patterns between the PJT performance and the involvement of implicit or explicit language aptitude among the L1 and L2 speakers were found. It was concluded that L1 and L2 speakers differed in terms of the way they processed the collocations, as well as the nature of their collocational knowledge.";"[Yi, Wei] Univ Maryland, 3215E Jimenez Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";"Yi, W (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, 3215E Jimenez Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.";"weiyi@umd.edu";"Yi, Wei/AAE-6567-2019";"Yi, Wei/0000-0003-0045-9746";NA;NA;NA;87;3;3;2;17;"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS";"NEW YORK";"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA";"0272-2631";"1470-1545";NA;"STUD SECOND LANG ACQ";"Stud.

Their oral production test performance resulted in two measures of automatization: reaction time (RD as an index of speedup and coefficient of variance (CV) as an index of stability/restructuring. The results showed that, while RT of both groups declined significantly after the training, the 3.3-day group exhibited greater propensity for restructuring than the 7-day group. Furthermore, procedural learning ability measured by the Tower of London task was significantly associated with RT, but not with CV, in the 3.3-day group only.

A group of L2 English learners (n = 51) performed three semispontaneous speaking tasks in their L1 Spanish and in their L2 English. In addition, participants performed articulatory skill tasks that measured the speed at which their articulatory speech plans could be initiated (delayed picture naming) and the rate and accuracy at which their articulatory gestures could be executed (diadochokinetic production). The results showed that fluency in spontaneous L2 speech can be predicted by L1 fluency, replicating earlier studies and showing that L2 fluency measures are, to a large degree, measures of personal speaking style.

The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension. Children also had greater difficulties in processing multiple-speaker cues during training.

In the exposure phase, the participants listened to and repeated words bearing stress patterned after Latin, but with a highly restricted consonant inventory. They performed a judgment task designed to test whether they had learned the relevant stress pattern regularities from the brief listening experience. We assessed participants' awareness of the inherent stress regularities by analyzing confidence in making decisions and by verbal report. Results suggest that although participants remained unaware of the underlying stress regularities they performed significantly above chance in endorsing correctly stressed novel items even when they claimed to be guessing. In addition, there was no difference in confidence between correct and incorrect judgments. These results suggest that brief exposure resulted in implicit knowledge of abstract stress assignment rules. However, participants rejected correctly stressed words that contained consonants that were not present in the test phase.

Eighty Cantonese and English musicians and nonmusicians completed two tasks: (a) AX tone discrimination and (b) incidental learning of artificial tone-segment connections (e.g., words beginning with an aspirated stop always carry a rising tone) with synthesized stimuli modeled on Thai. Although the four participant groups distinguished the target tones similarly well, Cantonese speakers showed abstract and implicit knowledge of the target tone-segment mappings after training but English speakers did not, regardless of their musical experience.

Avoiding this dichotomy, accumulating research shows superior results for guided induction, in which teachers help learners co-construct rules by directing their attention to relevant aspects in the input and asking guiding questions. However, no study has jointly investigated the effects of guided induction on both learning outcomes and processes, or whether guided induction can prove effective outside classroom settings where teacher mediation is not possible. In this study, which targeted the complex Spanish gustar structures, 70 English-speaking learners of beginning Spanish received either guided induction via a videogame, deductive instruction in a traditional classroom setting, or no instruction. Learning outcomes were measured via one receptive and two controlled production tasks (oral and written) with old and new items. Results revealed that while both instruction groups improved across time, outperforming the control group, the guided induction group achieved higher learning outcomes on all productive posttests (except immediate oral production) and experienced greater retention. Additionally, the think-aloud protocols of the guided induction group revealed high levels of awareness of the L2 structure and a conspicuous activation of recently learned knowledge, which are posited to have contributed to this group's superior performance.

However, exactly how these factors interact to influence language learning is unknown. This article examines the relationship between these three variables in language learners.Native English speakers were exposed to an artificial language containing three sentence patterns of varying linguistic complexity. They were randomly assigned to two groupsincidental and instructeddesigned to promote the acquisition of implicit and explicit knowledge, respectively. Learning was assessed with a grammaticality judgment task, and subjective measures of awareness were used to measure whether exposure had resulted in implicit or explicit knowledge. Participants also completed cognitive tests.Awareness measures demonstrated that learners in the incidental group relied more on implicit knowledge, whereas learners in the instructed group relied more on explicit knowledge. Overall, exposure condition was the most significant predictor of performance on the grammaticality judgment task, with learners in the instructed group outperforming those in the incidental group. Performance on a procedural learning task accounted for additional variance. When outcomes were analyzed according to linguistic complexity, exposure condition was the most significant predictor for two syntactic patterns, but it was not a predictor for the most complex sentence group; instead, procedural learning ability was.";"[Tagarelli, Kaitlyn M.] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Ruiz, Simon] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Vega, Jose Luis Moreno; Rebuschat, Patrick] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England";"Tagarelli, KM (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Life Sci Ctr, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.";"kaitlyn.tagarelli@dal.ca";NA;NA;"Department of Linguistics and English Language at Lancaster University";"We would like to thank Robert DeKeyser for early feedback on this project, as well as Aline Godfroid, Sarah Grey, Kara Morgan-Short, Antoine Tremblay, and John Williams for their comments and suggestions.

During the writing task, participants' key strokes were logged, and their eye movements were recorded. Immediately after the writing task, 12 participants also took part in a stimulated recall interview. The results revealed that, when participants paused at larger textual units, they were more likely to look back in the text and engage in higher-order writing processes. In contrast, during pauses at lower textual units, they tended to view areas closer to the inscription point and engage in lower-order writing processes. Prior to making a revision, participants most frequently had viewed the text that they subsequently revised or their eye gazes had been off-screen. Revisions focused more on language- than content-related issues, but there was a smaller difference in the number of language- and content-focused stimulated recall comments when larger textual units were revised.";"[Revesz, Andrea] UCL, London, England; [Michel, Marije] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Michel, Marije] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Lee, Minjin] Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea";"Revesz, A (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.";"a.revesz@ucl.ac.uk";NA;"Revesz, Andrea/0000-0003-1093-4336";"British Council-IELTS";"This study was supported by the British Council-IELTS joint-funded research program.

We engage key questions, debates, and shifts within GenSLA such as focusing on the deterministic role of input in language acquisition, as well as expanding the inquiry to new populations and empirical methodologies and technologies used. The second goal is to highlight the place of GenSLA in the broader field of SLA. We argue that various theories of SLA are needed, showing that many existing SLA paradigms are much less mutually exclusive than commonly believed (cf.

Significant learning gains were found in both the form recall and meaning recall tests, indicating that several knowledge aspects of FS can be learned incidentally from audio-visual input. The findings also revealed a positive relationship between learners' prior vocabulary knowledge and the learning gains. Further, several item-related factors affected the learning gains (e.g., collocate-node relationship, frequency).

A linear mixed model revealed greater processing loads evidenced in longer reading times on V-2 after intransitive verbs than after copular predicates. This finding echoes post hoc observations in Juffs (2004). These asymmetries were driven by significantly greater loads after unaccusative verbs than after copular predicates and unergative verbs.

Results confirmed a robust effect of PI training on picture-selection accuracy, yet the improvement did not differ between training modalities. Eye-tracking data revealed resilient looks to the incorrect (first noun 5 agent) picture even after training, demonstrating the challenge in tuning to the grammatical forms while processing auditory L2 input. The effect of voice familiarity was larger for the male voice, which had longer duration for the later cue (a Marie/Pierre) than the female voice.

Researchers in this area often compare experimental groups' performance against (a) statistical chance, (b) untrained control groups' performance, and/or (c) trained control groups' performance. However, each of these methods can involve unwarranted tacit assumptions, limitations, and challenges from a variety of sources (e.g., preexisting perceptual biases, participants' fabrication of rules, knowledge gained during the test), any of which might produce systematic response patterns that overlap with the linguistic target even in the absence of learning during training.

The modeling methods adopted allow the use of fine-grained, continuous factors for age and socioeconomic status, thereby effectively controlling for their effect and isolating the specific effect of bilingual experience.

Combining offline (vocabulary tests) and online (eye-tracking) measures, the incidental acquisition of vocabulary knowledge from reading and the online reading of unknown lexical items were examined. L2 English learners read a story containing unknown items while their eye movements were recorded. After eight exposures, L2 readers recognized the form and the meaning of 86% and 75% of the target nonwords, respectively, whereas they recalled the meaning of 55% of the nonwords. After three to four encounters, nonwords were read significantly faster, and by eight encounters they were read in a similar manner to previously known real words. Results also showed a positive relationship between new vocabulary learning outcomes and online reading, with longer reading times associated with higher vocabulary recall test scores. The study was also conducted with first language (L1) readers to provide baseline data for comparison.

Half the words were semantically related to each other while the other half were not.

The quality of the texts was assessed holistically using pairwise comparisons (D-pac). Confirmative factor analysis showed three components to be relevant to describe source use in L1 and L2 writing: (a) initial reading time, (b) interaction with sources, and (c) the degree of variance in source use throughout the writing process. Individual text quality remained stable in L1 and L2 throughout the academic year. Structural equation modeling showed that the approach in source use, especially source interaction, is correlated with text quality, but in L1 only.";"[Leijten, Marielle; Van Waes, Luuk; Schrijver, Iris; Bernolet, Sarah; Vangehuchten, Lieve] Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13,SZ 458, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium";"Leijten, M (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13,SZ 458, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.";"marielle.leijten@uantwerpen.be";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;79;6;6;3;11;"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS";"NEW YORK";"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA";"0272-2631";"1470-1545";NA;"STUD SECOND LANG ACQ";"Stud.

Following a comprehensive search, a sample of 97 reports were identified, contributing a total of 105 independent samples (N=19,933) from 23 countries. In the aggregate, the 216 effect sizes (i.e., correlations) reported in the primary studies yielded a mean of r = -.36 for the relationship between L2 anxiety and language achievement. Moderator analyses revealed effects sizes to vary across different types of language achievement measures, educational levels, target languages, and anxiety types.

The article also examines to what extent these difficulties can be alleviated by means of a relatively implicit type of form-focused instruction (Textual Enhancement, or TE). SSLI tend to omit the article before the possessive determiner (e.g., *mia macchina) and overuse the Prepositional Accusative (PA, the Romance languages' instance of Differential Object Marking) in canonical SVO sentences (e.g., *conosco a Marco). Although both structures pose learning difficulties to SSLI, the learning path that leads SSLI to acquire these two features is different: SSLI have to learn to add PPDA to their interlanguage and they have to unlearn PA, a property of their L1. Sixty-eight instructed SSLI were divided in two groups. Group A read five texts where the absence of PA was textually enhanced; group B read the same texts where the presence of PPDA was enhanced. The participants took a timed grammatical judgment test before, shortly after, and two months after the instructional treatment. The results show that the effects of the TE are different for PA and PPDA, which indicates that features to be unlearned are more difficult and require more explicit instructional intervention.";"[Della Putta, Paolo] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy";"Della Putta, P (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Educ & Human Sci, Via Allegri 9, I-41121 Reggio Emilia, Italy.";"paolo.dellaputta@unimore.it";NA;"della putta, paolo/0000-0001-8052-4776";NA;NA;NA;48;6;6;0;7;"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS";"NEW YORK";"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA";"0272-2631";"1470-1545";NA;"STUD SECOND LANG ACQ";"Stud.

These periods of physical inactivity, or pauses, during writing provide observable and measurable cues as to when, where, and how long writers halt to plan and/or revise their texts. Consequently, examining writers' pausing patterns can provide important insights into the cognitive processes that writers employ when composing and the impact of various individual, task, and contextual factors on those processes. This article discusses theory and research on writers' pausing behavior; how pause analysis can be used to investigate second language (L2) learners' writing processes; challenges in researching writers' pausing behavior (e.g., defining pauses); and some strategies to address these challenges. Next, the article illustrates how L2 writers' pause data can be collected, analyzed, and interpreted, using keystroke logging data from a research project that aimed to examine the effects of task type, L2 proficiency, and keyboarding skills on L2 learners' writing processes when writing on the computer.

Analyses revealed that the learners tested on the skill they had practiced outperformed those who were tested on the nonpracticed skill. This pattern was particularly pronounced in comprehension processing speed and production accuracy. Moreover, hybrid practice facilitated skill development more than blocked or interleaved practice alone. Furthermore, a dynamic interplay was detected among practice format, schedule, and learners' prior knowledge. Hybrid practice led to the least transfer from receptive skills (gained through input practice) to productive skills.

In prior work, comprehensibility was linked to multiple linguistic dimensions of L2 speech (phonology, fluency, lexis, grammar) whereas accentedness was narrowly associated with L2 phonology. However, these findings stemmed from a single task (picture narrative), suggesting that task type could affect the particular linguistic measures distinguishing comprehensibility from accentedness. To address this limitation, speech ratings of 10 native listeners assessing 60 speakers of L2 English in three tasks (picture narrative, IELTS, TOEFL) were analyzed, targeting two global ratings (accentedness, comprehensibility) and 10 linguistic measures (segmental and word stress accuracy, intonation, rhythm, speech rate, grammatical accuracy and complexity, lexical richness and complexity, discourse richness). Linguistic distinctions between accentedness and comprehensibility were less pronounced in the cognitively complex task (TOEFL), with overlapping sets of phonology, lexis, and grammar variables contributing to listener ratings of accentedness and comprehensibility.

Using structural equation modeling, we examined links among the six predictor variables, buoyancy, and L2 achievement and grade point average (GPA). The results showed that buoyancy significantly predicted both L2 achievement and GPA and mediated the effect of the predictors on these two outcome variables.

Listeners rated comprehensibility dynamically, using Idiodynamic Software to upgrade or downgrade comprehensibility over the course of the listening task. Dynamic ratings for one audio clip were video-captured for stimulated recall, and listeners were interviewed to understand which aspects of L2 speech were associated with enhanced versus diminished comprehensibility.

An objective method is proposed to identify the amount of school language experience beyond which bilingual children are likely to perform within the monolingual range, and show that relative passivity in the home language does not translate into better school language proficiency. Socioeconomic status is shown to interact in complex ways with language exposure, such that it is only above a certain level of exposure to the school language that the benefits of a more privileged background have a tangible impact on school language proficiency.

The acceptability of preverbal and postverbal subjects is compared considering different discursive contexts (i.e., broad focus, Verbal Phase [VP] focus, and subject focus). Three groups (i.e., native speakers, intermediate learners, and advanced learners), with 28 subjects each, took part in the study. Findings show that advanced speakers behave in a more nativelike manner than intermediate learners. Learners, nonetheless, are not capable of blocking the acceptability of preverbal subjects in those contexts in which native speakers disfavor them and show high productivity levels of underspecified L2 rules that lead them to accept postverbal subjects in infelicitous contexts (e.g., VP focus). These results are consistent with MG, the representation model proposed by Amaral and Roeper (2014), because an acquisition path can be described using simple rules with lexical or pragmatic restrictions, which may be targetlike. Optionality can be explained considering that L1 and L2 rules coexist and are never deleted, simply assigned different productivity levels or blocked.";"[Alvarado, Covadonga Sanchez] Univ Massachusetts, 161 Presidents Dr,Herter Hall 416, Amherst, MA 01003 USA";"Alvarado, CS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, 161 Presidents Dr,Herter Hall 416, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.";"sancheza@umass.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;42;0;0;1;2;"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS";"NEW YORK";"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA";"0272-2631";"1470-1545";NA;"STUD SECOND LANG ACQ";"Stud.

The results indicate that L1 speakers are superior to L2 speakers in the incidental acquisition of grammatical knowledge (experiments on subcategorization), except when the new knowledge interferes with previously acquired knowledge and mechanisms (experiments on [ir]regularity): Although both populations performed equally well regarding the acquisition of the subcategorization of verbs from the input (i.e., whether the verbs are transitive or intransitive), they differed with respect to the regularity status of new verbs. L1 speakers (in contrast to L2 learners) seem to disprefer irregularly conjugated verb forms in general, irrespective of their conjugation in the previous input.

Our findings show that experts' learning difficulty judgements did not lead to significant predictions, whereas the learners' own difficulty rankings correlated significantly with their performance on the measure of explicit knowledge.

Using a quasiexperimental design, 66 secondary-level learners of English as a foreign language from three intact classes were provided with four hours of instruction on the passive (a difficult structure) and the past progressive (an easy structure). Language aptitude was measured using the LLAMA Aptitude Test (Meara, 2005). Language outcomes were measured with a written grammaticality judgment and an oral production task. The results revealed that one of the aptitude components, grammatical inferencing, contributed to learners' gains on the passive but not the past progressive on the written measure. Another component of aptitude, associative memory, contributed to learners' gains on the past progressive on the oral measure. The results provide support for the claim that different components of aptitude contribute to the learning of difficult and easy L2 structures in different ways. There is also support for the proposal that different components of aptitude may be involved at different stages of language acquisition (Skehan, 2002).";"[Yalcin, Sebnem] Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Spada, Nina] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada";"Yalcin, S (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Foreign Language Educ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.";"sebnem.yalcin@boun.edu.tr";"YALCIN, SEBNEM/AAA-7896-2020";"YALCIN, SEBNEM/0000-0003-2143-8055";NA;NA;NA;70;9;9;6;25;"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS";"NEW YORK";"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA";"0272-2631";"1470-1545";NA;"STUD SECOND LANG ACQ";"Stud.

One hundred L2 learners of English in Sri Lanka were divided into four experimental groups and control group: input flood, input enhancement, a specific instruction to pay attention to the target grammatical construction in the input, and an explicit metalinguistic explanation of the target construction. Eye tracking was used to collect data on the attentional processing of 45 participants in the sample. The eye-tracking measures of learners who received a specific instruction to pay attention to the target structure and an explicit metalinguistic explanation indicated increased attentional processing. The learners in these groups also improved their knowledge of the target structure significantly. The results suggest that increased attentional processing is needed for development in L2 grammatical knowledge and that explicit instruction to pay attention to the input and metalinguistic explanation are successful in directing learners' attentional resources toward novel grammatical constructions in the input.";"[Indrarathne, Bimali; Kormos, Judit] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England";"Kormos, J (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist, Lancaster LA1 4YL, England.";"j.kormos@lancaster.ac.uk";NA;"Indrarathne, Bimali/0000-0001-7640-2565";"EAP of Lancaster University";"We are grateful for the support of the EAP scholarship of Lancaster University that partly sponsored this research project and to our participants in Sri Lanka for offering their time.

Second language (L2) learners are influenced by the same determinants as L1 speakers but to a lesser degree.

Our goal is to present arguments for using the term, not to evaluate the scientific validity of incomplete acquisition over other possible accounts. Although our conclusion is that the term should not be abandoned, we advocate a position whereby researchers consider the possible negative impact of the terminology they use and how they use it.

By examining how various training methods promote or fail to promote the development of high-quality orthographic, phonological, and meaning representations, and strong connections between these representations, we reconceptualize the current body of knowledge, and highlight gaps in the existing literature. We review evidence that training methods that only promote L1 to L2 form connections (e.g., massed repetition) are generally ineffective, but can become highly effective when paired with methods that also strengthen L2 form-meaning connections (e.g., spaced repetition training with retrieval practice or semantic elaboration requiring user-generated responses).

Additionally, three word-related variables (frequency of occurrence, cognateness, word relevance) and one learner-related variable (prior vocabulary knowledge) that might contribute to incidental vocabulary learning were examined. Two experiments were conducted with Dutch-speaking EFL learners to measure the effects of viewing TV on form recognition and meaning recall (Experiment 1) and meaning recognition (Experiment 2).
